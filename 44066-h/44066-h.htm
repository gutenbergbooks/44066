<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>


<p>Are you minded for a jaunt through the island
of Erin where tears and smiles are near
related and sobs and laughter go hand in hand?
We will walk, and will take it in donkey-cart and
jaunting-car&mdash;by train and in motor-cars&mdash;and
if you suit yourself you will suit me.</p>

<p>Leaving Dublin we will circle northward, with
a visit to Tanderagee Castle and the tomb of
St. Patrick&mdash;God bless him,&mdash;then on past the
Causeway and down to Derry, and so into the
County of Mayo, where in the midst of a fair
you will encounter the wildest "Konfusion"
and will be introduced to the gentleman who
pays the rent.</p>

<p>In the silence and solitudes of the island of
Achill you will see tears and hear sobs as you
listen to the keening for the dead. Near the
island of Clare, Queen Grace O'Malley will almost
order you away, as she did her husband, and your
motor with all its wings out will roll through the
grand scenery of the western coast&mdash;now down
by the ocean and then far up amidst the sombre
mountains&mdash;Kylemore Castle and quaint Galway,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[Pg vi]</a></span>
Leap Castle&mdash;ghost-haunted&mdash;and moated Ffranckfort,
Holy Cross and the Rock of Cashel&mdash;will pass
in stately array and be succeeded by a glimpse
of army life at Buttevant, and a dinner at
Doneraile Court, where you will hear of the
only woman Free Mason. Killarney will follow
with its music and legends, and Cork and
Fermoy, and so on and into the County of
Wexford, where you will rush through the lanes
and byways and will scare many old ladies&mdash;driving
as many donkeys&mdash;almost into Kingdom
Come. You will be welcomed at Bannow
House and entertained in that quaintest of
all earthly dwellings, "Tintern Abbey," which
was a ruin when the family moved into it more
than three centuries ago. You will visit the buried
city of Bannow and pass on to where Moore
watched the "Meeting of the Waters." You
will visit in stately mansions, and go with a wild
rush to the races at the Curragh. At Jigginstown
House you will be reminded of the cowardice of a
king, and as you bid farewell to Ireland you
will lay a wreath on the grave of Daniel
O'Connell,&mdash;all this and much more if you are
so minded.</p>

<p>"Glory be to God, but yer honour is welcome
to Ireland."</p>

<p>An old traveller understands that it is the
unexpected which makes the joy of his days.
I had come to Europe with the intention of
spending some conventional weeks in London,
followed by an auto tour with the family through
the fair land of France. Fate brings me, upon my
first day in town, to Prince's Restaurant, when
out of the chaos of faces before me rises one whose
owner, a son of Erin whom I had last seen under
the cherry blossoms of Japan, advances upon me.
Then the conventional promptly drops off and
away, and it is but a short while before a motor
tour is arranged in the Emerald Isle, a month
to be passed amidst its beauties and miseries, its
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
mirth and its sadness, for all go in one grand company
in the land of St. Patrick.</p>

<p>With Boyse of Bannow I shall follow the fancy
of the moment, which to my thinking is the only
true mode of travel.</p>

<p>"Du Cros" has agreed to furnish a perfectly
new Panhard for and upon the same terms which I
received in France last year, viz., thirty pounds
sterling per week, and everything found except
the board and lodging of the chauffeur. These
very necessary details arranged we are impatient
to be off and leave London on a hot day in June.
The smells, dirt, and dust of her wooden streets,
driven in clouds over all the grand old city, follow
us far out into the green meadows of England until
we ask whether the hawthorn blossoms have
ever held any fragrance, and have we not been
mistaken as to roses. But London is not all
of England, and we are finally well beyond
her influence and wondering why we remained
within her limits with the beautiful country
so near at hand. The meadows of England
giving way to the mountains of Wales, one
catches a glimpse of the stately towers of Conway
Castle, and then sails outward and westward
upon a level sea, which, on its farther side,
holds the haven of desire, Dublin, on the broad
waters of the Liffey.</p>

<p>Ireland welcomes us, weeping softly the while,
though smiling ever and anon as the sunlight rifts
downward from the west. The gang-plank is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
slippery and the pavements mucky, but our
welcome is a warm one, at least one fat, comfortable
looking old woman with a shawl over her
head, a gown whose colour I cannot attempt to
give, and shoes which have evidently been discarded
by her "auld man," greets me with a
"Glory be to God, but yer honour is welcome to
Ireland!" and then catching sight of my Jap
servant, she gives utterance to a very audible
aside, "Be the powers of the divil, phat's that
he has wid him!" crossing herself vehemently
the while, firmly convinced, I doubt not, that
she has seen a limb of Satan, which I think he
strongly resembles.</p>

<p>The Shelburn Hotel receives us within its walls,
unchanged in the thirty years which have elapsed
since I last crossed the threshold, a comfortable
inn, pleasantly situated upon College Green,
where a band of Irish musicians are discoursing
American ballads of the early sixties.</p>

<p>One runs into the tide of American tourists
here in Dublin, and to-night this hotel is crowded
with them. The clatter of tongues proving too
much for me, I dine and start to bed as soon
as possible&mdash;a good book and an easy resting-place
are attractive after the long ride from
London.</p>

<p>In the hallway I encounter the porter trying
to induce an old gentleman to go to bed. Said
gentleman is drunk as a gentleman should be,
and sound asleep in his chair, holding fast to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
a glass of whiskey and soda, from which no efforts
of the porter can part him.</p>

<p>"What's the number of your room, sir?"</p>

<p>The sleeping eyes half open as the happy man
murmurs, "Wasn't you tryin' to stale my whiskey
just now?"</p>

<p>"Well, I thought, sir, ye would be more comfortable
in yer room."</p>

<p>"Let slapin' dogs lie, me boy. But 'twas in
a good cause ye did it, and so I'll go," and he
staggers off to the lift, sleeps on my shoulders
until I get out, and probably on the bench for
the rest of the night, as that small lift boy could
never move that bulk, redolent of whiskey and
good humour.</p>

<p>So far I have heard nothing from Boyse, who
was to have rejoined me here, and, when ten
o'clock comes round, give him up for the night,
and putting out the light am shortly in the land of
dreams, only to be awakened by a clatter on the
door followed by the entrance of the missing
man. He has put up at the Club, having reached
here ahead of me. Our car he reports ready for
us at nine to-morrow morning, and I shortly
drive him out as it has gotten late.</p>

<p class="pmb3">One must be of a sour disposition if one does
not laugh in Ireland, and be assured her people
will always laugh with one, though at times there
sounds a catch of a sob running through it all.
Seat yourself on any spot in the island, and something
funny is apt, nay almost sure, to occur
before you depart; all of which is apparently
arranged for your especial benefit.</p>

<p>It is raining this morning and it is Sunday, which
in the dominions of his Majesty does not mean a
day of diversion unless you happen to be a guest
in some country house. I am in a secluded seat
on the portico of the hotel, when directly before
me, on the only spot of pavement visible, appears
a girl of fourteen dressed in everything which
could never by the widest stretch of the imagination
have been intended for her when purchased.
She summons "Katie darlin'" not to be such a
"truble" to her, but to appear and "spake to
the gintleman," whereupon from around the
corner of a stone post comes "Katie darlin'," a
mite of a child some two feet tall with a pair of
black eyes sparkling all over her dirty little face.
She is robed in what looks like a blue plush
opera-cloak on wrong side in front and festooned
over what were once shoes; her shock of never
combed hair is topped by an old woman's bonnet.
"Katie darlin'" is evidently out for her Sunday.
She is glad to see every one, and especially "Your
honour" after the reception of a "ha'penny."
Bless her dirty little face, what will be her portion
in this life, I wonder! Yet, after all, being
Irish, she is safer than if born of another race,
for the women of her land do not go down to
death and destruction as easily as those of other
countries, be it said to their credit. God grant
it may be so with "Katie darlin'," who goes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
smilingly away to meet whatever fate the future
holds for her, and which disturbs her not at all
as yet.</p>

<p>The morning of our start from Dublin opens
windy and with drifting clouds but is a fair day for
hereabouts, and after all these grey skys are very
soothing to one's eyes.</p>

<p>Our motor rolls up at ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span> and proves to be
a handsome new Panhard of fifteen horse-power.
Packing and stowing take a half-hour the first
day, as economy of space is to be desired, and
the proper arrangement of luggage is a question
to be considered. However, all is done and I
roll off to the "Kildare Street Club," where
Boyse awaits me.</p>

<p>His traps necessitate a new arrangement of all
the luggage, which I am not allowed to superintend
at all, but am carried off to a room well to
the rear where a whiskey and soda is vainly
pressed upon me. I should much prefer to stay
outside and boss the job of loading up, but
that would be undignified. So we stay cooped
up until all is arranged, and then sally forth
and roll away with the utmost grandeur of demeanour.
I object several times during the day
to the arrangement of those traps, impressing upon
Boyse the truth of the old saying, "if you want
a thing done, go,&mdash;if not, send&mdash;" and pointing
out to him that therein lies the reason for the
increasing glory and prosperity of our country
and the evident decadence of the British Empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span></p>

<p>He does not take me as serious,&mdash;perhaps I am
not,&mdash;but daily life must have its spice and we
spend many hours like Pat and "Dinnis" on the
quay at Cork of a Saturday evening, "fighting each
other for conciliation and hating each other for
the love of God."</p>

<p>Speeding away through Dublin's busy streets
and out into Phœnix Park, existence becomes
life once more. The rushing winds drive the
last taint of the city and its world of men and
women off and away. Beyond the confines of the
park we enter at once into the green country;
tall hawthorn hedges toss their branches above
us as we speed onward, the car moving like a bird.
These are not French roads but they are far from
bad. Mile after mile glides by us, and a sharp
rain forces the top over our heads, but not for
long,&mdash;it is soon down again, and we give ourselves
up for an hour to the enjoyment of mere motion.
And then history claims our attention. Dublin
is of course rich in its memories but leave it for
the present and speeding westward some thirty
miles pause at the foot of Tara Hill, the most
renowned spot in Ireland. There are few in our
Western land who do not remember the sweet
old song of Moore's:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The harp that once through Tara's halls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The soul of music shed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now hangs as mute on Tara's walls<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if that soul were fled."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p>And there are many to whom its melodies will
recall those better days when voices long since
sunken into silence sang them off into dreamland
with those words.</p>

<p>Green grow the grasses to-day over this site
of Ireland's most ancient capital. Gone are its
garland-hung walls, silent its harps for ever.</p>

<p>Leaving the present behind, one passes into
the remotest recess of the island's past as one
mounts the hill. To-day wavering misty shadows
close in around me as I move upward, even as
though the spirits of the ancient kings and minstrels
were yet about, and the winds moan as
though driven across the strings of many harps,
and there seems melody all around me.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Tara is not a great hill, but a fair green mound
from which the ancient kings were wont to spy
out all the fair land around them. It was the
most sacred spot in the kingdom and none could
wear the crown who bore blemish of any sort.
Cormac Mac Art, the great King, was, upon the loss
of his eye, forced to retire to the hill of Skreen
near-by. For twenty-five hundred years, Tara
was the palace and burial-place of the kings of
Ireland, who every third year met here in great
convention. To-day as I stand on its summit
nothing of that period, save some long mounds,
breaks the green carpet of grass thrown like the
covering of our holy communion over this holy
of holies. Tara was mentioned by Ptolemy and
he called it "illustrious." Its name by some is
supposed to be taken from that of the wife of a
King, Heremon, the first monarch of Ireland.
"Thea" was her name and the place was called
Temora (the house of Thea), but others call it
"the house of music" (Thead, a musical chord,
and mur, a house).</p>

<p>The main hall stood nine hundred feet square
and "twenty-seven cubits in height." It held its
thousand guests daily and on great days the
monarch sat on his throne in its centre, his
flowing yellow hair bearing the golden crown, his
stately form clothed in a brilliant scarlet robe
laden with rich ornaments of gold. Golden shoes
ornamented with red buckles and bearing stars
and animals in gold, were upon his feet; the
King of Leinster sat, facing him, the King of
Ulster sat on his right, the King of Munster
on his left, while the King of Connaught sat
behind him. On long rows of seats before him
were the druids, bards, philosophers, antiquaries,
genealogists, musicians, and the chiefs of all the
towns of the kingdom. The assembly was opened
by the chief bard, followed by the druidical rites,
after which the fire of Saman, or the moon, was
lighted. Not until then was the business of the
convention taken up. In one part of the palace,
the youths were instructed in poetry and music and
initiated into the hidden harmony of the universe.
Evidently in those days a city must have surrounded
the base of this hill, but of the houses of the
people little seems to be known and nothing is left.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>In these long mounds the traveller to-day may
trace the outlines of the hall composed of earth
and wood from whence one hundred and forty-two
kings ruled the land, the great King Cormac
dating back to <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 227, and he it is who is
supposed to have built this hall. Some claim that
the celebrated "Stone of Destiny" now in the
coronation chair in London was taken from here
to Scotland. Of this there is no proof, but so
runs the legend.</p>

<p>There is only the music of the wind-swept
grasses on Tara Hill to-night, yet surely the moon
rising so grandly yonder still holds her feast
and is summoning her worshippers from the
mists of the valley rising in fantastic forms all
around us,&mdash;but the only thing bearing semblance
of human form which she illumines is a crazy statue
of St. Patrick here on the spot where he met
and, by the power of the Lord, vanquished the
magicians of the king. There could be no fitter
heir to inherit and so we leave him in sole possession
and go down to our car, which rolls us silently
away through the green lanes and on towards
Trim's ruined arches and towers. Now the tall
"yellow steeple" of the Abbey of St. Mary's,
founded by St. Patrick, and close into the town
the great Castle of King John loom up in the
moonlight. Vast in extent, the castle appears
doubly so in this shadowy light, as we glide by it,
a huge empty shell covered with clambering ivy.</p>

<p>Rolling on through the town we pass to Navan,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
dear to hunters. All this is a fair green country
where the grass is good for the cattle, where the
poultry thrive, and the Boyne is full of fish, hence
one notes on all sides the ruins of many monasteries,
for those old monks were always to be found
where their stomachs could be well taken care of;
and yet with all that they were the power in the
land, as the priest is still the power in southern
Ireland.</p>

<p>Leaving Navan we turn northeastward towards
Drogheda. The road winds all the way by the
banks of the Boyne and while that name recalls
to mind most prominently the famous battle of
the kings, James and William, still the region was
celebrated long ages before either was thought
of. The whole valley was a vast necropolis for
the ancient kings and druids, and on both sides
one sees the remains of a remote antiquity,
especially at New Grange where one finds a
tumulus covering some two acres. At first glance
it resembles an Indian mound in America, but
it is far more satisfactory to explore as one finds
in its interior a tomb of extraordinary size and
rich in carving, which is supposed to date as far
back as the earliest bronze age, but who was
buried here is a question which has never been
settled.</p>

<p>We enter by a passage on its southern side
about fifty feet long,&mdash;a stone corridor formed by
upright slabs about seven feet high and roofed
by stones of great size. Our glimmering candles
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
show the centre tomb to be a lofty domed chamber,
circular in form, its roof composed of horizontally
placed stones projecting one beyond the other
and capped by a single slab some twenty feet
above the observer. There are three recesses
branching off from the rotunda, probably the
tombs of the lesser mortals, while the body of the
monarch evidently occupied the centre space.</p>

<p>There is another sepulchre of equal size at
Dowth, and doubtless every hill or mound in
sight holds others. If the Boyne as it winds and
murmurs past them could speak, it could doubtless
tell us tales of kings and druids, of royal
coronations and priestly ceremonies, of life and
death in the long dead past. How was it all, I
wonder? Was it picturesque and beautiful or
did the barbaric side crowd all that down and
out, leaving nothing save a shuddering feeling of
horror as one gazed on the rites of the druids?</p>

<p class="pmb3">These tombs were rifled by the Danes a thousand
years ago, and therefore, aside from the carvings on
their walls, have yielded but little of interest to the
antiquary. There is nothing of animal or human
life represented, merely coils, lozenges, and spirals,
with now and then a fern leaf, but nothing which
tells their story as do the Egyptian inscriptions.
This valley of the Boyne is beautifully
wooded and the roads are fine. Our route
lies past the obelisk marking the famous battlefield
where the sun of James II. set for ever.
The valley is lovely and reminds one greatly
of that of the Thames near Richmond. It has
taken most of the day to make the chauffeur
understand that we are not out to kill time and
distance. At the rate he would like to travel we
should reach Iceland in time for tea even with the
ocean to cross, but, as I have forced him to retrace
the route several times, he seems at last to
understand our determination not to rush.</p>

<p>The whole day's ride has been charming. We did
not stop at Drogheda, but passed on to Newry, a
twelve-mile ride over a very fine road, and rested at
the Victoria Hotel, having covered one hundred
and three miles since eleven this morning, with
long stoppages several times. The auto has done
splendidly and will do better as it gets down to
work.</p>

<p>This is the Protestant end of Ireland, prosperous
and contented apparently, but not picturesque.
That goes with the state of affairs to be found in
the southern half.</p>

<p>Newry is a clean town with neat shops and
houses, and a good hotel, still there are Irish
characteristics which those of us who remember
the Irish maid of long ago in America will recognise
at once. Many things are broken, "jist came
that way"; a complete toilet set is unnecessary
where there are windows; and I notice that
the salutations sound always wrong end first,&mdash;when
people meet they say "Good-night," a form
never used elsewhere except when parting.</p>

<p>Apparently the hotel is the social club of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
town, where the men of a certain class gather
in the evenings, and drawing their chairs in a
circle before the bar, spend an hour or so in chaff
with the barmaid, drinking porter the while.
To-night the talk is of a more serious nature and
turns on trade.</p>

<p>It is claimed that what kills all chance of
Ireland being a profitable country are the railway
rates, that, for instance, it costs more to get
corn from Galway to Dublin than from America
to any point on the island.</p>

<p>I asked an Irishman whether Gladstone had
benefited Ireland, and he replied, "he was the
cause of all our trouble, he cost Great Britain
two thousand millions sterling and countless
lives, and yet they put up statues to him."</p>

<p class="pmb3">The traveller of to-day sees no sign of the upper
classes in Newry, though there are estates all
around it, and in turning the pages of its history
he will discover that it is a place of great antiquity,
though its streets to-day show no signs thereof.
Prosperous and commonplace would best describe
it. However, it is just the prosperous and commonplace
which the traveller most welcomes as
night comes down upon him, for there, and not
amongst the romantic and picturesque, in Ireland
at least, does he find comfortable quarters and
good food. So it is to-night and so to bed and
dreams.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">Through Newry to Tanderagee Castle&mdash;Life in the Castle&mdash;Excursions
to Armagh&mdash;Its History&mdash;The English in
Armagh.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>Our route lies from Newry north-west through
Pointz-pass, beyond which as we approach
Tanderagee, the castle, a stately stone structure,
is seen towering high on a forest-crowned hill with
a flag denoting its owner's presence floating from
the main tower.</p>

<p>While the castle is a modern structure of some
seventy-five years of age,&mdash;originally built by
the Count de Salis,&mdash;it stands on the site of
the very ancient stronghold of Redmond O'Hanlon,
the most noted outlaw of Ireland. As we
roll through the quaint town clustering around
the hill, where every soul appears to have gone
to sleep or gone dead long since, the sound of
the motor brings a few pale faces to the doors
of the houses, but it is very quiet withal.</p>

<p>Looking upward from this street the growth of
trees is so dense that no sign of the castle is
visible. We pass through almost a tunnel cut
through the rocks and trees, and emerging in a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
spacious courtyard, draw up at the main portal
where the <i>maître d'hôtel</i> meets and conducts us
within, our hosts being off somewhere in their
motor but will return shortly.</p>

<p>This gives us time for a quiet inspection. We
find ourselves in a long, wide, and lofty corridor
having a row of windows on its right, while on the
left one has entrance first to the main hall and
chapel, stately apartments very richly decorated,
and then in order follow several drawing-rooms, a
library, and a spacious dining-hall, and from the
walls of each and all, the painted faces of those
who walked these chambers long ago look down
upon us with questioning gaze as though they still
retained some interest in this world of the living,
and yonder dame would, I know, like to hear the
latest news from London; but take my advice,
my lady, and let it pass, it is productive of just
the same unrest and discontent now as when
you trod the boards of that great theatre of
life,&mdash;Dead Sea fruit, the whole of it.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Wondering what part she played in life, my
eyes wander to an open window and straightway
all thoughts of Madam vanish as I gaze downward
through the glades of one of those beautiful
parks which abound in these dominions. A
stately terrace of stone shrouded in ivy runs below
these windows and from it the land drops away
into a gentle valley filled with great trees and
blossoming banks of rhododendrons with here and
there a stretch of grassland and a gleam of water,
a vista which must have been a perpetual delight
to the Duke who collected these books in this
library, for a lover of books is generally a lover
of nature.</p>

<p>Passing onward you will enter the courtyard
and at the end of the long arcades on one side
find the billiard and smoking rooms. On the
upper floors, aside from the state and family
apartments, one finds long rows of bachelor
apartments, twenty or thirty of them I should say,
and in the middle of the row a cozy octagon
chamber where much high revel has held forth,
and which looks very lonely just now. There
are small closets in the walls which certainly
did not hold holy water.</p>

<p>But times are changed at Tanderagee, and
while there is to-day high revel within its walls,
it comes from the fresh young voices of children
and would in no way appeal to the ghosts which
haunt the octagon chamber.</p>

<p>After luncheon we visit the little ones in their
rooms high up in the sunlight, and very happy,
fine children they appear to be. Round-eyed
little Lady Mary did the honours and presented
her brother, who at the time was making vain
attempts to stand on his head in a corner, while
the new baby dreamed his days away in a crib
by the fire. I am told that the present Duke
dying without an heir the estate would pass to a
Catholic owner, much to the distaste of the
tenants here, who are mostly Protestants, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
that when little Lord Mandeville was born the
rejoicings were immense,&mdash;every man as he heard
it having a pull at the church bell. Now there
are two sons and hence little chance of the dreaded
misfortune,&mdash;though it often happened during the
Boer war that many estates in the empire fell to
those so distant that no hope had been entertained
for an instant of their so passing. Let us trust it
will not occur here, for these are fine children.</p>

<p>Passing downward, we spend some hours in
wandering over the park, pausing at last by
the grave of the late Duke in the little churchyard.
I did not notice the graves of any other
members of the family. I believe former dukes
are interred at Kimbolton, the family seat in
England. The church holds some very beautiful
windows erected by the present Duchess to the
memory of her mother, Helena Zimmerman.
As we return to the castle the voices of the
children have roused all the echoes of the courtyard
into wild replies and now the sunlight
streams downward as though in thorough approval.</p>

<p>Tea-time, that most pleasant hour of the day,
finds me in the chapel listening to the soft tones
of the organ. My hand quite haphazard
picks up a volume lying near me whose title
at once chains my attention and in view of the
base manner in which the author afterward
sold his talents to her enemies and slandered his
Queen it may be well to quote what he says of
that Queen in this preface:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>

<p class="center">
"<span class="smcap">To the Most Illustrious Mary Queen of Scots</span>.<br />
[An Epigram of George Buchanan.]</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">Madam</span>:

<p>"Who now happily holdest the sceptre of the Caledonian
coast conveyed from hand to hand through a
long line of innumerable ancestors, whose fortune is

nobility of thy manners,</p>

<p>"Receive (but with candour and good nature) these
poems upon which I have bestowed a Latine Dress,

of mine lest I should reject what thou hast been

perhaps they will obtain from thy good-will and
approbation."<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Deep in thoughts of that most interesting period
of Scotch history I do not even hear the dressing
bell until its clangour becomes too insistent to be
disregarded, and I mount to my room to dress
for that most important function of the day&mdash;dinner.
A bright fire makes the chamber warm
and cozy so that it is difficult to resist the temptation
to further reverie.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>Evidently Tanderagee has been greatly improved
of late years. In the building have been
placed several modern bathrooms, a Turkish
plunge, and an electric light plant and steam heat,
so that the damp, penetrating cold and musty,
mouldy smell usually so ever-present in these
houses, where fortunes are so constantly spent
in decorations and so little done for actual comfort,
are absent. From my window I can see on
the lake of the park an ancient swan named
Billy, alone in all his glory and from choice
and bad temper, not necessity. He has killed
off all his kind and all other kinds, is in fact a
degenerate bird, and when evening comes on he
betakes himself with the rest of the "boys" to the
village street, and loafs around all night, no dog
in the place daring to molest him. I saw him
outside of a public house there with a desire for
strong drink expressed in his eyes. He is a rake
of the worst character but you dare not tell
him so. He leaves the park every night before
the gates are closed and returns next morning.</p>

<p>There are fine drives in all directions hereabouts,
and the roads being good we have many
a rush in the motor-cars,&mdash;one to an old ruin
where the devil is supposed to leave the impress
of his foot upon a plank in the floor each night.
I doubt if to-day even the devil could reach
the plank through the accumulation of dirt
thereon.</p>

<p>As we wait in the quadrangle one morning
for our motors, to my astonishment I am accosted
in salutation by a name used only at home, and
by those I have known for years. "How de do,
Mr. Mike?" Around me rise the walls of the
castle, but aside from the expressionless faces
of the house servants standing near I can see no
one until in a dark corner of the court a yet blacker
spot suddenly shows a white gleam of teeth, and out
into the light comes the speaker. "How de do,
sir?&mdash;I'se de cook on de boss's car, and I knowed
you all your life. Don't you remember nigger
John and Miss Nancy Ballentine?" Convulsed
with laughter, I can scarcely answer. This
explains the hot bread and waffles on the breakfast
table, which surprised me for the moment,
but which I had entirely forgotten. Bowing and
scraping came black "Tom" into the sunshine
and it seemed to do his heart good to talk of
the old times, of Black John our own cook, and
Miss Nancy Ballentine, who "tended de ladies'
waitin' room in the C. H. &amp; D. station" when she
was not assisting at the marrying or burying of
most of us, at the latter wearing a dress composed
of the crêpe from many a doorbell. That it did
not match in degrees of blackness mattered not
at all to the good dame. She arranged it in
stripes and she could tell you which particular
funeral each of those stripes came from. She
has been dead many years, and to have her
recalled here was strange indeed, but&mdash;the cars
come with a rush, and we are off with a rush,
speeding through the beautiful park whose trees
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
certainly equal any I have seen except of course
those of California.</p>

<p>I find that my fifteen horse-power Clements
keeps up very fairly with the Duke's motor of
sixty horse-power. Of course on the wide straight
roads of France this could not be, but on these
narrow and crooked lanes of Ireland we are never
very far apart, and have had many good runs
together.</p>

<p>Our motoring carries us often to the town of
Armagh where one comes across traces of the
hatred of that Catholic Queen, Mary I., for the
Irish. She burned this see and three other
churches. The cruelties of that Queen to the
people of Kings and Queens counties equals
anything told in Irish history, but is rarely
mentioned by the historians of the day. In fact,
all the territory forming now those counties was
stolen from its ancient owners and the name
changed as above, resulting in a warfare which
lasted into the reign of Elizabeth until the people
finally disappeared into the mountains. No torture
or cruelty was spared.</p>

<p>In <i>Forgotten facts in Irish History</i> we read
that "it seems very apparent to the student of
Irish history that these people received their
persecutions not because they were <i>Catholics</i>, but
because they were <i>Irish</i>. The most terrible
persecutions took place under the Catholic sovereigns
of England and not until those monarchs
became so-called heretics was the Church of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
Rome turned against them, so that at the present
time it is the effort of all to show that the persecution
if it exists is because of the religion."</p>

<p>The history of the archbishopric of Dublin is an
object-lesson on the exclusion of the Irish from
the Church ever since the Conquest. From 1171
down to the Reformation, in 1549, there were
twenty-three archbishops of Dublin. Of these
not one was Irish. For the archbishopric of
Dublin "No Irish need apply!"</p>

<p>The Statute of Kilkenny enacted that no religious
house shall receive an Irishman, under
penalty of being attainted and having its temporalities
seized.</p>

<p>One historian of our times asks:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"But would any Irishman have the hardihood to
say that if King Edward VII. were to become a
Roman Catholic (which heaven forbid), and to go
hand in hand with the Papacy in the prosecution of
their Imperial and world-wide projects, that the Pope
would oppose the King in any tyrannies he might be
disposed to inflict upon Ireland which did not run
counter to the interests of the Roman Catholic
Church? Would the Pope risk the friendship of the
ruler of a great Empire for the sake of what Italians
regard as 'a mere eruption on the chin of the
world'?<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The centuries of oppressive treatment which Ireland
received while the whole kingdom was under
the 'shelter of the wings of Rome' amply explains
the animosity which rankles in the Irish heart towards
England and everything English. The whole
story of that almost forgotten period is a series of
murders, cursings, tyrannies, betrayals, rapacity,
hypocrisy, and poverty, which scarcely finds a
parallel in the range of history."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Armagh has suffered terribly throughout the
years since St. Patrick founded the cathedral, but
though abounding in memories, there is little
existing of the past in the town to-day. The site
of its cathedral is very fine, but the building has
suffered a complete restoration.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Our days at Tanderagee have passed pleasantly
but they are over at last and bidding our hosts
adieu we roll off towards Newry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">Through Newcastle to Downpatrick&mdash;Grave of St. Patrick&mdash;His
Life and Work&mdash;The Old Grave-Digger&mdash;Belfast
and Ballygalley Bay&mdash;O'Halloran the Outlaw.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>It is nearly six o'clock when we start from Newry
towards Newcastle. Our road lies down the
river, and so on by the sea the entire distance.</p>

<p>The highway is excellent all the way, some
thirty-two miles, and the car speeds onward like
a bird. The scenery is lovely, the glimpses of
mountain and meadow, sea and sky enchanting.</p>

<p>About 7.20 brings us to the hotel at Slieve
Donard, a very large costly establishment built
by the railway company. It is evidently a
watering-place of some importance, and next
month (July) will see it crowded. The place is
pleasantly situated by the sea and presided over
by the Mourne Mountains. There are golf-links
and the walks and drives are fine, but otherwise
there is nothing of interest, and we shall move
northward to Dundrum.</p>

<p>The morning is clear and crisp as we leave
Newcastle, getting lost at once in the many
byways, but that is rather a pleasure than an
annoyance. All the roadbeds are fine hereabouts
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
and we roll merrily along over hill and down dale
until Downpatrick comes into view, and we
pass up her streets to her ancient cathedral, and
there pay our devotions at the grave of St.
Patrick.</p>

<p>The church stands well above its ancient
city and is visible from all the country round about.
Several places claim the birthplace of St. Patrick,
but that benign Scotchman was born near Dunbarton.
He himself says that his father was
a deacon and his grandfather a <i>priest</i>. He was
a nephew of St. Martin of Tours, the sister of
that holy man having been the mother of the
Irish patron. His name was Succat, but it is by
his Latin name of Patricius that he is known best
to the millions who revere his memory.</p>

<p>Ireland during its first millennium was called
Scotland, and its people "Scots," and by these
St. Patrick was taken prisoner when he was
but sixteen years of age and carried to Antrim,
where he was held for six years and forced to care
for the swine of Michu, a chieftain. We are
told that this occurred in the mountain of
Llemish near Ballymena. During this period his
thoughts were ever turned towards Christianity
and after having effected his escape he is next
heard of at Auxerre with its Bishop, Germanus,
by whom he was admitted to holy orders. His
thoughts always turned towards Ireland and here
he landed when he was sixty years of age near the
present church of Saul on Strangford Lough in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
432 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> This was but four miles from Downpatrick,
and there the Lord promptly blessed his
work by enabling him to convert the chieftain
of the district, Dichu, to Christianity, receiving
as a gift the barn of that same chieftain, which
formed the first Christian church of this island.
The present church of Saul stands on the spot
and that name is but a corruption of the ancient
one of "Patrick's Sabball," or barn.</p>

<p>From here the faith spread until it covered all
the land, and here in 492 he died.</p>

<p>Both Armagh and Dundalethglass&mdash;Downpatrick&mdash;claimed
a right to provide him with a
tomb, and to settle the dispute two untamed oxen
were yoked to his bier, and they stopped on this
hill of Downpatrick. As to what sort of a wild
ride they gave his saintship before, out of wind,
they rested on this hill, history is silent, but, being
Irish, there is no doubt but that he thoroughly
enjoyed it.</p>

<p>I have always regretted that during an ocean
voyage which I once made with the late Bishop
Donnelly, I did not make inquiry concerning this
funeral progress, for I have no doubt but that
his reverence&mdash;he was not a Bishop then&mdash;knew
all about it. I have never met any one who more
thoroughly appreciated the sunshine and sorrow,
the laughter and tears of the land he loved so
well, and I greatly regret that that voyage was so
short and that the good Bishop so soon thereafter
entered into his rest. But to return.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span></p>

<p>As far as the actual grave of St. Patrick is concerned,
there is, of course, no certainty; that he was
buried somewhere on this hill appears beyond
doubt, and probably near the spot the church was
built on, but that his body remained long in the
grave after he was elevated to the sainthood is
clearly doubtful. Probably every church in Ireland
has at one time contained a relic of his. As for
this original church here, it is spoken of way back
in the sixth century and again in the eleventh.
The first claimed to have been erected by the
saint himself.</p>

<p>The relics of Columba were brought from
Iona here and it is related that it was that saint
who enshrined those of St. Patrick just three-score
years after his death. In his tomb were
found his goblet, his Angel's Gospel, and the
Bell of the Testament.</p>

<p>Into St. Patrick's tomb went also the bones
of St. Brigid. The Danes came here, and Strongbow
and King John passed by.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The present church is supposed to be only the
choir of the great edifice&mdash;the second church&mdash;built
by De Courcey and destroyed by Edward, Lord
Cromwell in 1605; but it is so completely restored
that it is of little interest, though very comfortable
withal.</p>

<p>Just outside there stands a venerable grave-digger
amongst the tombs, who might almost
have been here fifteen hundred years ago, and
certainly he would resent any insinuation that he
was not well informed upon all which may or may
not have occurred since the death of the saint.
He is leaning upon his rake near the church door,
and returns our salutation in an antique manner,
nothing about him as it were, belonging to this
latter day or date. "Yes, the cathedral can
be visited, but perhaps 'twould be as well to
visit the tomb, I will show you that,&mdash;who
better?"</p>

<p>It is off amongst a tangle of tombstones and
high grasses, a great flat irregular boulder engraved
with a Celtic cross and the saint's name&mdash;evidently
the sinful dead have crowded as closely as possible
around the saintly ashes in order perhaps to
pass into the heavenly gates unobserved with
such great company to chain the attention of St.
Peter. But some of these around started on their
last journey hundreds of years after St. Patrick,&mdash;still,
as we are told that "in His sight a thousand
years are but as yesterday," perhaps they all
arrived together, and I doubt not that for his
beloved Irish the holy Patrick would delay his
entry as long as possible and even come back again
from that farther shore at the calling of some
late comers.</p>

<p>When I ask this grave-digger whether this be
indeed the grave of the holy man, he looks wise,
plucks a bit of grass from a near-by grave, and
seizes his opportunity for an oration. It is
useless to stop him with questions, he will answer
as and when it pleases him; and so, sitting upon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
the tomb with the sunlight falling in a glowing
benediction upon us living and upon the old
cathedral and its silent company, he speaks on
and on. "There's many, your honour, phwat has
heads but don't use thim. Is this <i>the</i> grave you
ask. Well I have puzzled out the question for
many years. I <i>don't</i> believe it is, as I suggested
this spot to the antiquary society myself. In
owlden days the spot prayed upon as his tomb
was under yonder middle window of the church,
but whin a bishop came along who wanted more
silf-glory than one driveway would give him,
he made that one there, and in so doing moved
the owld tombstone,&mdash;not that I am claiming
that even that was the first one laid upon the
blessed corpse, for an owld woman of eighty who
lived here until she was ten and then moved
away, came back to bid farewell to her native
town on going to America, and upon being shown
the tomb undher the window asked since whin
had the dead taken to moving their graves, for
whin she left here it was below there in the valley.
But we know it was around here some place, and
this new spot is as good as any other." "Did
St. Pathrick build that church?&mdash;no, sure, yer
honour, he was not the kind of a man who wint
around glorifying himself. If he had had as much
money as that cost 't would be the poor who
would have got it. Still, the church yonder is
fifteen hundred years old, though it has been so
built over that it is hard to believe it."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span></p>

<p>The old man would have talked on for ever, but,
like most of his age, it would have been but vain
repetition, and so we move off and away, feeling
sure that the spirit of the benign old saint returns
now and then in floods of warm sunlight to his
ancient cathedral of Downpatrick.</p>

<p>Like most grave-diggers, the man up there
knew more of the past than of the present, and
when he told us that we would find a fine ferry
from Strangford across the outlet of the lough
of that name he spoke without advisement. We
found a proposition to place some planks from
one boat to another and so to ferry us and our great
machine over one of the deepest, swiftest currents
passing outward to the sea. It is useless to say
that I vetoed this proposition, so we rolled backward
almost to Downpatrick, and then turned
north-west towards Belfast, which we reached for
luncheon.</p>

<p>When I pass a city like Belfast without notice,
it is not that there is not much of interest there,
but that it has been so often described, and I would
confine these notes to those more unfamiliar
spots with which Ireland abounds, places of which
the general run of travellers knows nothing. Yet
Belfast, like its great neighbour Glasgow, possesses
much of interest of which the guide-books make no
note.</p>

<p>Leaving the busy city of the north, our route
lies towards the sea and by the sea for some hours,
the roads all very good. We pass Carrickfergus
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
and Larne and on the shores of Ballygalley Bay,
coming to a sudden stoppage, discover on investigation
that our stupid chauffeur has allowed
the gasoline to run out. What to do is a problem,
as we are some miles from any town and the
road is a lonely one. To assist in a solution of
the question Boyse goes to sleep in the motor
and I go out on a lonely rock at sea where O'Halloran,
that most renowned outlaw in Irish history,
built his tower,&mdash;all in ruins now. For ten years
he kept all this district in subjection and was
killed in 1681.</p>

<p class="pmb3">There is but little left of his stronghold here&mdash;an
angle of a tower, an outline of a wall or two,&mdash;all
on a tiny island around which murmur the
waters of the Irish Sea, while far out, seemingly
afloat, in the hazy distance rise the shadowy shores
of Scotland. That is Cantyre and Arran over
yonder. There are no sails in sight and the sea
is asleep. The high-road winds away close down
by the shore on either hand, while high behind
it the fantastic cliffs tower some three hundred
feet and more, wild and desolate. To have
passed this way in the days of O'Halloran, without
paying heavy tribute, if he allowed you to go at
all, would have been well-nigh impossible, and our
further progress, unless that petrol comes, is as
effectively prohibited.</p>

<p>But there is peace about just now, the drifting
clouds above, the lapping waters and silent hills
all around, Boyse still sleeping, and the auto
seemingly dead, while Yama occupies a pinnacle
of an adjacent rock, a bronze Buddha on its
travels, as it were. But far down the coast road
a white speck shortly evolves into a jaunting-car
laden with petrol cans&mdash;we had sent word back
by a passing cyclist&mdash;whose contents are promptly
transferred into our tank, and then with all paid for
we glide away to the north, with one last glimpse
at the ruined tower in its bay of Ballygalley.</p>

<p>I should make the chauffeur pay for his stupidity
about that petrol, but I don't suppose I
shall do so.</p>

<p>The ride to Ballycastle is joyous, the road very
fine and smooth, running now by the glistening
sea and then far up a thousand feet amidst the
silence of the hill and moors, over which flocks
of sheep are browsing upon grass rich and thick.</p>

<p>Several towns are holding fairs, and we have
met two "Irish gentlemen" returning home
who would not care to-day whether the Emerald
Isle got her freedom or not. One led a huge
stallion which pranced and snorted at our passing,
but while unable to stand straight, his keeper
held on to his charge, and I doubt not got him
home safely, occupying most all the roadway
in his progress. It will be a very sorry day indeed
when an Irishman, no matter what his condition,
cannot hold on to a horse.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Ballycastle is reached at eight o'clock and we
find quarters in a very comfortable inn&mdash;the Marine
Hotel,&mdash;after a run of over one hundred miles.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">Ballycastle to the Causeway&mdash;Prosperity of Northern Ireland&mdash;Bundoran&mdash;Gay
Life in County Mayo&mdash;Mantua
House&mdash;Troubles in Roscommon&mdash;Wit of the People&mdash;Irish
Girls&mdash;Emigration to America&mdash;Episode of the

</blockquote>


<p>It is nineteen miles from Ballycastle to the
Causeway. Immediately upon leaving the
former place, in fact quite within the town's precincts,
we struck one of those steep short hills which
seem greatly to try the temper of motors. While
they will later mount much more difficult and
longer slopes, with apparently no difficulty, such a
hill so soon after breakfast always disagrees with
them, and so it was just here. In fact, it looked as
though we must get out and walk, but with an
additional spurt and snort it was over the summit,
and we tobogganed down the other slope at a
speed which made us hold on tightly.</p>

<p>All this ride to the Causeway is up and down
the wildest hills, close beside yet high above the
neighbouring ocean, and at times the route lies
down such steep inclines that I confess I take
them in great trepidation, commanding Robert
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
to go slowly. This he consents to do at the
very summit, but half-way down with what a
whiz and a roar do we finish the descent, rushing
far up the next incline!</p>

<p>There is a safer, far safer, route just inland, but
the vote was against that. Yet at times when
the wind is roaring past us, as we rush downward
and we realise that a break in any part of our
car might hurl us over the wall and hundreds of
feet downward, we almost wish we had selected
the safer route. The road is so close to the cliff's
wall that the prospect along the coast is at all
times grandly impressive while from far beneath
arise the vague, delusive voices of the ocean.
Pausing for a space we cross the wall and creep out
on to a projecting headland and drink in the
superb panorama. Far below us and far out to
sea spreads the great floor of the Giant's Causeway,
while on either hand away into the hazy
distance of this lovely day in June stretch the
fantastic cliffs and headlands of this romantic
coast, showing by their jagged outlines the effects
of their ceaseless battle with the sea. On the
headland where we stand green grasses spangled
with buttercups roll inland into broad meadow
lands and towards distant purple mountains. This
world may hold more lovely spots than Erin's
Isle, but if so, I have never seen them.</p>

<p>As there are very few signboards in Ireland a
motor tour is a constant study of the map and
one must come provided with such. Before
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>
leaving London I purchased a set of Stanford's,
seven in all, covering this island, and
very finely gotten up.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> It is a pleasure to study
them and a child could scarcely go wrong, though
we have enjoyed the pleasure of getting lost
several times.</p>

<p>So far my luck of two years back in France,
as to weather, has followed us. Aside from one
shower the first day we have had fine weather
all the time, not all sunshine but no rains, and
the cool grey skies with rifts of sunlight breaking
through them, illuminating like a searchlight
spots of the land or sea, are beautiful.</p>

<p>The auto has settled down to serious work by
now and rushes singing along, working better and
better as the hours fly by. Leaving the Causeway
our route lies inland through Bushmills, Coleraine,
and Limavady.</p>

<p>All this end of Ireland appears prosperous. The
highroads and villages are well kept. The land
is strongly Protestant, its men and women fine,
serious specimens of humanity, and there are no

<p>Lunching at Londonderry we made a rapid
run to Bundoran on the Atlantic coast. The
ride was pleasant with good roads nearly all the
way, part way over the highlands and part by the
shores of Lough Erne. Bundoran is a desolate,
bleak sort of watering-place, lonely and dispiriting,
but with a comfortable hotel of the Great Northern
Railway Company.</p>

<p>We depart next morning with every feeling
of satisfaction. It is a dreary place and the life
led therein is dreary also. The power of the
ocean is so great here that it has carved the whole
coast with caverns and gulches until the observer
wonders whether it will not eventually carry off
Bundoran, town, hotel, and all.</p>

<p>So we roll off into the sunshine and from the
moment we enter County Sligo the fun begins.
A spirited sprint with half a dozen young steers
leads us through a group of jaunting-cars from
which our passing causes men and women to
descend in anything but a dignified manner.
One portly dame in a white cap slips and sits
down upon mother earth with much emphasis.
Her remarks, though few, were to the point.
Another gathers her skirts well around her waist,
and regardless of a foot or more of panties takes
a flying leap over a mud wall, and "Glory be to
God's" resound on all sides. A flock of geese in
attempting escape through the bars of a gate get
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
wedged therein, and keep the gate going by the
motion of their wings, and as it swings to and fro
rend the air with their squawking. On the whole
the excitement would satisfy the most exacting
and there is more to come.</p>

<p>This being the feast of Sts. Peter and Paul has
been seized upon for fairs, and in all the villages
great preparations have been made for their celebration.
Towards each town droves of animals,
mostly cattle but also many pigs, the latter
scrubbed to cleanliness, make stately progress,
the pigs in carts bedded with straw&mdash;not a
mortal in any of the fairs is as clean as the pigs.</p>

<p>We were approaching one of these fairs, and
moving as slowly as could be if we were to move
at all. Cattle and pigs were all around us and
generally paid no attention to our car, but one
sportive young heifer decided otherwise, and with
a snort and a whisk of tail she was off in the opposite
direction. Evidently a leader of fashion
in her circle, she created a fashion there and then
for there was scarce a pig or cow which did not
follow suit, urged on by many dogs. The noise
and confusion was appalling, and the manner in
which old men and women, comfortable Irish
"widdies," young men and maidens, took to trees
and stumps gave added animation to the landscape.
By this time we had come to a halt. I
did not want to laugh, and the suppression of that
emotion caused the tears to course down my face.
Just then a man advanced towards us, his face
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
aflame, his raised right arm grasping a bowlder,
while as he came onward he shouted furiously,
"I'll larn yez, I'll larn yez." There was nothing
to do save sit silently, and this we did. The
nearer he came, the lower got his arm, until he
had passed us as though we were not there.
Then the arm went up again and all the fury returned
while the air rang with his "I'll larn yez,"
but towards whom directed it was impossible to
determine as he walked steadily away from us
all the time. I cannot say that I altogether
blame him as it must have been somewhat difficult
for the owners to separate their new purchases
from that concourse of rushing animals.
What a good time they had to be sure!</p>

<p>The man was our first instance of hostility in
Ireland. In fact the people were generally very
friendly towards us, assisting whenever assistance
was required, which fortunately was not often.
Certainly we met with none of the jealous hatred
which often greets a prosperous looking man in
France, and causes him to think of the guillotine,
or the lowering glances and sometimes violence
of the Swiss. Still the Swiss have some justice
on their side. The passing machine covers the
meadow grass with dust and the cattle will not
eat it, which to the people spells ruin.</p>

<p>However, auto cars cannot be kept out of
Switzerland, and her government should take the
matter in hand and, by oiling the highways,
obviate the difficulty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>No oil will, however, ever be needed in Ireland.
While we had but one rain during the entire tour
of the first summer, the night dews did away with
all dust. As for the highways and lesser avenues
and byways, I expected to find much that was
rough and almost impassable, but on the whole they
are all very good indeed. Except in Galway I remember
none that were bad, and I circled the entire
island and crossed and recrossed it many times.</p>

<p>From Sligo we take a run through the county
of Roscommon, which seems to suffer most from
these evil days, and to carry on its face a look of
sadness and neglect. Things are not at rest here
and the press daily holds its records of "outrages"
in Roscommon, but let us leave that until to-morrow.
Certainly there are no traces of it as
our car rolls up the broad avenue of Mantua
House, the estate of Mr. Bowen, where as the rain
comes down a warm welcome and bright fire cause
us to forget that there is storm and darkness outside
and perhaps sorrow and trouble all around.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Mantua House is a spacious, square building,
in a large park. It has some three centuries to
its credit but yet it is a cheery, pleasant abiding-place
and smiles at the passer-by like a saintly old
lady. It is said that the fairies abided once under its
doorstep and when some few years ago a vestibule
was added an old woman appeared and kneeling
down cursed the workmen for disturbing them.
But the little spirits do not seem to have minded
it much and the inhabitants of the "House in the
Bog" live on in peace. My night's slumber under
its roof was undisturbed and dreamless.</p>

<p>There is much of interest in the house in the
shape of portraits, and those of seven generations,
whose owners had passed their lives here, looked
down upon us while at dinner. I fear I appear
morose and a bad guest for I cannot keep my
eyes and thoughts from these old portraits, wondering
what the lives of their owners were and
how I shall feel if ever my painted face looks down
from some shadowy canvas on a company at
dinner a century or two hence. If such portrait
should exist it will probably be marked "Portrait
of a gentleman" as one so often reads in a catalogue
when name and owner are long, long forgotten
as of no importance. How poor a thing
is earthly immortality and yet how we all long
for it, how we dread to be amongst those "<i>forgotten</i>."
But they are not "forgotten" in Mantua
House, as I was told the names and dates of all of
them. Later, in the glow of the turf fire, those
around us in the spacious hall almost quicken
into life and gaze into its glowing depths as we
are doing and as they have each in turn done in
the old mansion, until the bell of time sounded for
them and they passed away into shadowland.
I think that for glowing warmth and depth of
colour a turf fire surpasses all others. The brown
earth burns deeply but glows to its very heart,
and as it burns throws off a pungent smoke which
recalls to your memory the "Princess of Thule,"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
and finally getting into your brain drives you off
to bed and the mantle of sleep falls upon the
"House in the Bog."</p>

<p>It is a misty morning in which we bid our hosts
good-bye but not to be too hard upon us the sun
shines now and then as we roll off between the
dripping hedgerows whose boughs, reaching at us
as though endeavouring to stay our progress,
scrape the top of our hood as the car glides onward.
As I have stated, the county of Roscommon
suffers more than any other section of Ireland
in these days of "cattle driving." Here it is first
impressed upon the traveller that there is trouble
abroad. Numbers of men with lowering glances
loaf around doing nothing save smoke their
stumpy pipes and all the rich land hereabouts
stands neglected and deserted.</p>

<p>As to this driving of the cattle which is the
cause of most of the trouble, the landowners
generally rent their fields for grazing, but the
people are determined that they shall <i>sell</i> them
their lands and at prices dictated <i>not</i> by the
<i>owners</i>, but by the <i>purchaser</i>. This being refused,
they will not allow the grazing, and drive a man's
cattle back to him, leaving the land of no profit
to its owner, and hoping thereby to force him to
their methods. There would appear to be small
justice in all this.</p>

<p>There is much trouble of this description all
over the island but it is only in Roscommon that
the fact has impressed itself upon us and we hear
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
of it constantly. One man told me that he had
been out with seven packs of hounds which had
been poisoned and related the story of a landlord
who spent not less than forty thousand pounds
a year on his estate keeping it and his tenantry
in the best of conditions. He was waited upon
by a committee from the League, who informed
him that if he allowed certain men, all his friends,
to hunt with his hounds, he and his pack would
be boycotted. He replied that he lived in the
country because he considered it his duty to
do so, that he spent all his money here for the
same reason, giving employment to hundreds,
keeping all in plenty, but that if such a threat was
carried out, he would sell everything and leave.
It was carried out, and he closed his estate, sold
his horses and hounds in England, and left this
island, the loss to his section being enormous, and
all for the sake, as in most of our "strikes," of a
few ringleaders who fatten on the poor men they
hoodwink, while their families starve.</p>

<p>At present a man may go into many sections of
Ireland and demand land, placing his own price
thereon and the owner has got to accept it.
What an opportunity for dishonesty lies there!
It is so common for all Europe, and I have noticed
several very bitter "communications" in the
Irish press lately&mdash;to point to the so-called lawlessness
of America, <i>i.e.</i>, the United States, that
it is something to note the present state of affairs
in parts of Ireland. For instance, here in Roscommon,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
no man has been convicted of murder for
years, yet there have been many terrible crimes
of that sort committed; one where a son and
daughter murdered their old father on his doorstep
that they might get the little place. They
were tried and <i>acquitted</i>. Again every one has
heard of the case of Mr. and Mrs. Blake which
occurred but lately in Galway. Refusing to sell
their lands they were both fired upon and wounded
while returning from mass and almost under the
walls of the church. The people standing round
simply roared with laughter. No one was apprehended
for that crime though every one in the
country could tell who were the assailants.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is scarcely just for an outsider to pass upon
the affairs of a foreign country, but when, as I
have stated, one's own land is constantly held up
to the most violent criticism, while at the same
time the daily press of our critics teems with reports
of like and worse in their own country, one
cannot be blamed for so doing.</p>

<p>I was told later that there is much trouble
around Cashel, but personally I saw no signs of
it save in Roscommon. Elsewhere it is very
easy to disbelieve the reports, for surely in no part
of the world are the prospects more entrancing to
the traveller&mdash;on the surface at least&mdash;than in this
island with its lovely lakes, its beautiful mountains
and seas, its picturesque people, and above all its
luxuriant vegetation. Every old tower is shrouded
in ivy, and the grass is soft as velvet, showing the
richness of the soil, and is beautiful beyond description.
With all their sorrow and tears these people
appear full of sunshine and laughter, and if you
smile at them you are always greeted pleasantly,
while you find them at all times full of jests and
quaint humour which keep you in a constant state
of laughter. The other day I gave a man a sixpence
as a tip. Being possessed of true politeness, he
would not directly reflect upon my generosity, or
the lack thereof, but gravely regarding the coin
a moment, and scratching his head the while in
a meditative fashion, he exclaimed, "Bad luck to
the Boer war which blew the two shillings away
and left the sixpence."</p>

<p>It is almost impossible to change the habits and
customs inborn in these peasants, no matter how
many years may be passed in foreign lands. It
is a well-known fact that girls that have lived
in cleanly, pleasant homes in America, with all
which that means, on returning here, as they often
do, and marrying some Irish lad, soon sink to the
level from which they had raised themselves by
emigrating. Their savings all gone to buy the
hut from their husband's brothers and sisters and
poor as when they left Ireland, they are soon seen
standing barefooted in the manure and filth,
pitching it into a wretched cart, drawn by a most
wretched looking donkey, all their good clothes
and dainty habits a thing of the past and I doubt
if greatly regretted.</p>

<p>Occasionally, however, the reverse holds true.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
A lady not long since came over bringing her
Irish maid with her, and on reaching Queenstown
told the girl that she could, if she desired, go home
for a visit and rejoin her mistress later in Dublin.
The girl went, but before the mistress reached
Dublin the telegraph wires were laden with
messages from the maid, so fearful was she that the
mistress would leave her, and when she rejoined
her remarked with a gasp, "but ma'am, I did not
know it was like that; why the pig slept in the
room wid us." But there are not many who
mind the pig and a girl returned and married
here will cuff her children, dirty with dirt which
would have sickened her while in her American
home, out of the way of the "gentleman who
pays the rent."</p>

<p>As for the emigration of these or any other
peoples to our country, if they who come are
honest and willing to work, they will find no difficulty
in obtaining plenty of employment, provided
they go where it is and do not expect it to be
ready to their hand on landing. Most who get
into trouble and, returning home, tell woful tales
about impositions, etc., are those who insist upon
remaining in the congested districts of the East.
The whole South and great West, from St. Louis
to the Pacific, and from Canada to Mexico, is open
to them, a vast empire, where all may live if they
will work and where there is room for all who
come. The systems of irrigation in action and
proposed by our government, in the west, are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
reclaiming a vast empire yet to be peopled, while
in the South labour brings high figures and is difficult
to obtain, especially in our great cotton mills
in South Carolina and Georgia and in the lumber
mills of Florida.</p>

<p>But thousands who come to us have no intention
of working and insist upon remaining around and
in our crowded cities and districts where the devil
soon finds plenty of employment for their idle
hands, and his arch agents&mdash;ward politicians&mdash;lend
him most efficient assistance. I know that
only last winter one of the owners of a great
lumber mill in Florida, at his own expense, brought
from the immigrant bureau in New York a large
number of men who no sooner got to Florida than
they ran off and became tramps, having from the
start no intention of working.</p>

<p>That there is much truth in <i>The Jungle</i>
and other books of like sort is beyond doubt,
but there is no necessity for any man, woman, or
child's remaining in such places unless he so
desires. Most of them having lived in abject
poverty and wretchedness at home, continue, by
nature, to do so abroad, and will never change,
and such as these by their very habits contribute
largely to the state of affairs described in that
book. The hope lies in the future, not for them,
but for their children, who certainly <i>will</i> change.
Such change is difficult if not impossible after
man's estate is reached, not only with the poor
but also with the well-to-do and rich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span></p>

<p>To all proposed emigrants to the United
States I would say again, if you are honest men
and will come willing to work, you are welcome
and there is plenty for you to do and space for all.
If you expect or insist upon loafing around the
cities, declining work, and expecting to be supported,
you will be disappointed, you will end in
the workhouse&mdash;stay away, we don't want you.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The roads through Roscommon from Mantua
House are bad. We encountered but few good
stretches for some miles from that house; then
they became better. On one of these we were
making rapid progress down grade, when suddenly
some hundred or so yards ahead two men came
out from a gateway leading a huge black mare.
She was evidently restive and we slowed up but
as we came to a stop a hundred feet off she reared,
broke loose, and fell over backwards, then rolling
over plunged forward towards a gate and succeeded
in fastening the metal pointed horns upon
her collar so securely under the bar of the gate
that she was held immovable upon her knees.
Notwithstanding her great power she could not stir
an inch. When the gate was thrown open, she
sprang forward in the wildest fright and her owner
stood by and cursed us to the extent of his ability.
He certainly heard us coming and should not have
brought her out, but it's all one-sided with horsemen,&mdash;they
expect to do exactly as suits them and
if anything happens, the other party, no matter
what they are on or in, are always to blame. In
every case we come, as we did there, to a dead
stop at once, and I must say that all of our accidents
have arisen because the men have much
less sense than the horses, which I notice in
nearly every case rarely evince fright until their
owners jump at them and drag at their bridles.
I have never listened to a more perfect line of
curses than were poured forth in that case; they
seemed to linger in the air long after we had placed
hills and dales between ourselves and the old man,
which we did as soon as possible.</p>

<p>As we stopped for luncheon later on I questioned
a car driver as to a large building near by.</p>

<p>"Is that a court-house over there?"</p>

<p>"Yis, sir, but we haven't much use for it.
Only open it wanst a fortnight, and shortly we
won't open it at all, at all. Thim lawyers've
'ad their own way long enough, it's time the car
drivers had a show." (Wherein lawyers interfered
with car drivers was not stated.)</p>

<p>"Are you mostly Catholics around here?"</p>

<p>"Yis, sir."</p>

<p>"Is not that a Methodist chapel yonder?"</p>

<p>"Yis, but not much good at all, and would
shut up altogether only some old man with more
money than sinse left it twenty pounds a year."</p>

<p>Passing onward into the highlands, we stopped
for water at a little stone house, from which the
children swarmed out like flies,&mdash;seven,&mdash;belonging
to one man, and his wife ventures the statement
that if we come back in seven years there will
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
be seven more. She speaks feelingly; evidently
there is no race suicide here.</p>

<p>This far western Ireland is much like the highlands
of Scotland, but far wilder. Auto cars are
rarely seen here. While the land is still orderly
and apparently prosperous, I think I note the
change towards the shiftlessness so prevalent in
the south. There are many roofless and abandoned
cottages and the heaps of manure are becoming
more frequent.</p>

<p>We shall shortly reach Newport near Clew Bay
and pass on to Mallaranny and Achill Island, the
wildest part of Ireland. Well up into the hills, we
pause for some slight repairs, and the usual group
of men and boys, a girl and a dog, appear as from
nowhere and squat on the adjacent bank. They
say they can speak the ancient tongue and
that all the old customs and usages are still
in vogue hereabouts. I ask for a wake, but
that puzzles them. "It might be difficult to
arrange, sir." However, I shall probably attend
one before I leave the land, hoping that
it may not prove my own. I ask if these
boys live near here.</p>

<p>"They all do, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, it's a beautiful spot." His eyes and
mine wander off over the solitary moorland and
up to the more solitary mountains.</p>

<p>"It is indade, sir."</p>

<p>"I have a streak of Irish blood in my own
veins," I venture to add.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have ye, now, sir, and were ye born in
Ireland?"</p>

<p>"No, we left here more than two centuries
ago."</p>

<p>"Time you war havin' a wake indade, sir." That
turns the laugh on me, and I throw a shilling at
the crowd for drinks, which results in a wild
scramble down into a muddy ditch and a wilder
waving of legs in the air as each and all go head
first into the mud.</p>

<p>Quiet restored, my former conversationalist,
somewhat the worse for mud, remarks. "And indade,
sir, ye seem to have a good time, 'tis wishin'
I am that all the people here had the likes," and
with an echo to the wish and a wave of the hand
we glide off and away into the valley.</p>

<p class="pmb3">This ride has indeed been beautiful, but just
as we enter the village of Mallaranny (County
Mayo) and are speeding down a steep incline, a
little yellow-headed urchin toddles directly across
our track; a catastrophe seems unavoidable;
women shriek and howl, and men stand paralysed,
but one old crone grabs the boy just as Robert
brings our car to a halt, with not six inches to
spare. The baby, not at all frightened, howls
with rage because his progress has been cut short.
The old crone proceeds to spank the child until
I tell her that if any one deserves punishment
it is herself for her neglect. A few more miles
brings us to the hotel and in a very sleepy state,
as the air all day has been chilly; but we are not
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
so sleepy that we cannot see at once that this is
not such a chamber of discomfort, such a cold
storage as that place at Bundoran. In point of
situation and objects of interest there can also be
no comparison. As a centre to explore this
beautiful section and study these people Mallaranny
could not be improved upon. The house
stands high and overlooks land and sea for miles,
and in whichever direction the eye roams the
prospect is attractive, while Bundoran Hotel stands
on a bleak moor over which the howling winds from
all the North Atlantic sweep with terrible force.
The town is dreary and of no interest, and the
mountains too far away, while the climate is raw
and unpleasant, whereas Mallaranny, much to the
south, is swept by balmy winds and well sheltered
on the north. Both places have salt water in the
house, but here the bathrooms are large and the
tubs are small swimming-tanks. There is a man
at the head of that house and a woman at the
head of this, and there lies the difference so far
as the houses are concerned. Of course I do not
mean to state that it is warm here. In fact the
air is cold all over the land, and while there have
been no rains so far, we wear fur coats and use
fur robes all the time, and would be most uncomfortable
without them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">The Island of Achill&mdash;Picturesque Scenery&mdash;Poverty of the
People&mdash;"Keening" for the Dead&mdash;"The Gintleman
Who Pays the Rint"&mdash;Superstitious Legends.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>The island of Achill lies off the west coast
of Ireland. Exposed to the full fury of the
North Atlantic winds it is one of the bleakest spots
on the globe. The manners and customs of its
people change but slightly with the passing years.</p>

<p>Leaving the hotel on a misty morning, we roll
off towards the sea. The way is narrow for a
car and we pass uncomfortably near sleeping
brown bogs whose quiet waters would promptly
cover us up and suck us down past all resurrection
were our wheels to slip over the brink.</p>

<p>Reaching a hill up which a man is driving
cattle, our chauffeur sounds the horn and pushes
gently forward, causing the animals to give way,
whereupon their owner holds up his hand in indignant
protest with a "Would ye dhrive the
<i>cattle</i>!" To his thinking we should plod slowly
up that miles-long hill behind his herd rather
than cause them to move to one side,&mdash;to "dhrive
the <i>cattle</i>!" being in his eyes little short of sacrilege.
Yet his sort does not hesitate to drive other
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
men's cattle off of still other men's land, and
consider it their right so to do.</p>

<p>The long muddy road runs on the cliffs over
the sea and finally turns down towards the coast,
apparently losing itself in the waste. This is
not the highway and we so discover in season to
prevent an accident. Just then a small boy
comes racing after us shouting that we should
have turned off higher up. A few half-pennies
and our thanks make him smilingly offer to return
and show us the route, and a lift in the car
completes his happiness,&mdash;the first time he has
ever ridden in an automobile, I doubt not.</p>

<p>The traveller does not notice anything unusual
until, having crossed the Peninsula of Curraun, he
enters upon one of the strangest spots on earth.
In the foreground, deep in a valley is a mysterious
pool, black as night: all around rise the gloomy
mountains, while over the peak to the west the
sun is sending long shafts of purple and gold
into the distant hollows, where brown turf fields
stretch away, and low-walled, whitewashed,
and thatched cottages spot the landscape, and
the scarlet skirts worn by all the women throw
splashes of vivid colour here and there. The
whole is gloomy and sombre to a degree. The
winds blow coldly and we draw our furs closely
about us as the car speeds onward over roads not
made for such usage. This indeed is ancient
Ireland and one hears the Celtic tongue on all
sides.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Holiday is held here as in Sligo, and the
encounters with cattle and ponies are frequent.
Here is a pony drawing a load of heavy timber
which he insists upon running off with on our
approach. Of course, we halt until we can creep
by him. Yonder is a man to whom the fair has
proven a not unmixed blessing. He lies upon
his face on a bank, blind drunk, and will not take
home with him the drinks consumed at the fair.
His wife and father stand by trying to hold an
old horse, but the bridle breaks and off he goes
ahead of us, losing finally both blanket and saddle,
and vanishing up a mountain. Another old
gentleman, held on his horse by a dutiful son,
curses us to the King's taste but in Celtic which
we do not understand. Only the women are
sober after the day's bout, and many is the
beautiful face set off by the scarlet dress, which
greets us smilingly or hides its sorrow from our
glances.</p>

<p>Now the road grows wilder and wilder,&mdash;there
is absolutely no sound save the moan of the distant
ocean.</p>

<p>As we near the remotest part of the island,
where the mountains raise their heads in solemn
grandeur, there are no signs of human habitation
except one lonely cottage. Its door is
open, but there is no evidence of life. Suddenly
the air shivers with the weirdest, loneliest
cry I have ever listened to,&mdash;a sustained,
penetrating wail rising and falling on the sad
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
air and then shuddering away into silence,
silence, silence rendered all the sadder by the
fast approaching shadows of night. It is the
famous "keening" or mourning cry for the dead.
There are professional keeners and when one is
informed of a death she starts for the house of
sorrow and commences this melancholy cry as
she goes. All the way over hill and dale, by
these dark pools and through the bog pathways
she goes, her cry bringing the women and
children to the doors of all the huts. As she
approaches the dead the cry dies away and
ceases as she enters the cottage. Walking round
the bier she commences anew and passing outward
and away fills all the silence of the deepening night
with her melancholy plaint. To hear it any place
in Ireland is sad enough, to hear it amidst the
desolation of Achill is almost terrifying and never
to be forgotten. To-night it sounds like the
voices of lost souls from the depths of the dark
Atlantic.</p>

<p>I have heard a cry like that from the Arab
women of a desert town, but nowhere else on
earth, and I doubt if any other people possess one
of such concentrated, desolate sorrow as this,&mdash;a
sound which almost makes the heart stand still.</p>

<p>Why should these people mourn the advent
of peace? Surely it is better for them to sleep
than to wake; better to die than to live.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Through the open doorway of this hut as we
pass we catch but a glimpse of an old woman bowed
in sorrow and a sheeted, silent form on the bed
in the corner.</p>

<p>Our car glides slowly and silently by and we
move onward, more and more into the island
of Achill, into the heart of ancient Ireland,
until, rounding the shoulder of a desolate mountain,
we come suddenly upon the sea. This
is no bay or inlet, no capes guard us here, there
is no lighthouse in sight to indicate that man
ever sends his ships out there. That is the heart
of the ocean, the deep sea. The waves, black as
midnight and hurled forward with the force of the
Gulf Stream, and all the currents of the North
Atlantic, come thundering in with such power that
one instinctively draws backward, while the coast
is all cut and jagged, torn up and thrown pell-mell
by the ceaseless onslaught. You realise that
just out there are vast depths, awful forces, and
that once within their grasp nothing save an interposition
of God could save you; even this land
scarcely seems a safe abiding-place.</p>

<p>The sky above is black as the waters beneath it
and the winds sough upward from the underworld
as though laden with the misery of these people
of Achill.</p>

<p>Are there not scenes and times when the great
truth of the existence of the Deity is impressed
upon one? By the deep sea, amidst the solitude
of the mountains and the silence of the desert,
from the song of a bird far overhead, and always
from the eyes of a little child does not the assurance
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
come to man, past all doubting, that verily there
is&mdash;a God? Has the atheist ever existed who
has not experienced this many times throughout
his wretched life?</p>

<p>The face of Ireland in the far western section
seems constantly covered with tears. The sadness
and poverty of the people passes all comprehension.
Surely the love of their home land
must be very great to keep them here at all.</p>

<p>Lady Dudley has established a most excellent
charity hereabouts in the shape of contribution
boxes for the establishment of district nurses in
these the poorest sections of Ireland. The girls
have a sadly hard time of it as often they find
nothing to rest on in these hovels save a box or
head of a barrel. We are stopping in front of one
now that would be considered unfit for cattle at
home, a low stone hut thatched in rotting straw
patched up with turf. There is no window, and
the door has no glass. The interior, plainly visible,
is horrible in its sodden wretchedness. Before
the doorstep is a bog of manure and all kinds of
filth in which the pigs and ducks are at work. As
our eyes wander away and up to the hills, white with
stone, we wonder why in God's name with feet to
walk upon every soul does not leave this island,
which is not intended for man to live upon; yet
here they are and plenty of them, and many seem
cheery and happy. The woman of this wretched
hovel before us is pitching manure into a cart,
and as she stands, barefooted, in the filth above
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
her ankles, sings and talks to me in the liveliest
fashion. Just beyond is a bog whose waters,
black as night, and spangled with water lilies,
reflect as in a mirror a flock of geese and a woman
in a brilliant scarlet petticoat. Beyond rise the
mountains sombre and gloomy and over all
lowers a sky dark with storms. Then the rain
falls, but only for an instant, when the sunlight
descending in long shafts of intense light turns
even this scene of desolation into one of beauty.
If these people were moved into a richer and more
fertile section would they remain there, or would
one shortly find these filthy hovels occupied again
by their original owners? If so, their love of
home passes comprehension.</p>

<p>One cannot but feel that many of the countless
millions yearly sent to foreign missions were better
spent here, where, by improving the body, the
salvation of the soul would be more easily attempted,
for it is impossible to believe that with
such horrible, sordid conditions, there can be any
deep belief in the goodness of God.</p>

<p>When in Teheran, Persia, I could not but observe
the extensive missionary buildings, and when
I asked what people the work was amongst, the
reply came "Nestorian Christians." So, all the
contributions from the churches are expended
upon those who are already Christians. For (as
is certainly not known at home) a Persian to be
converted does not mean loss of caste as in India
but <i>death</i>, and hence conversion to Christianity
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
amongst them is impossible. Persia is the most
fanatical of all nations, where one may not even
look into a mosque, much less enter, yet millions
continue to pour into that land yearly. Comment
should be unnecessary, but I cannot help
feeling that comment is needed when looking out
over a scene like this before us to-day. There
are plenty of plague spots in our own new land
which need close attention; for instance, in the
mountains of Virginia where the people are so ignorant
that they not only cannot read, but do
not know what reading is. It is a disgrace to
our land that the ministers from these mountains
are forced to go begging through the churches
for money to carry on their work, but,&mdash;it is
not half so picturesque and interesting to help
such as to send millions to the land of the Sultan
of Ispahan and perchance be able to rescue
some Lalla Rookh or encounter the veiled prophet
of Khorassan.</p>

<p>I find I am very apt&mdash;so to speak&mdash;to tumble
off the island of Achill into almost any part of the
world, so let us return once more.</p>

<p>The population of Achill is steadily decreasing,
and now counts but forty-six hundred. These
people have been described as a lot of thieves and
murderers with, I should judge, very little justice
in the charge. They had no such appearance to
my eye.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The soil on the island is so thin and poor that
her men cannot raise enough upon it to pay their
rent and are forced to seek every year work in
more favoured sections.</p>

<p>It is claimed these islanders consist of four
great families, whose members can be easily distinguished
from each other, the French Lavelles,
the English Scholefields, the creole Caulfields, the
Danish Morans. But there are also pure Irish
to be found in the O'Malleys, Gaughans, and Monahans.
The houses are but heaps of rude stones
(which have been moulded by the tide), round of
gable, and roofed by fern, heather, and shingles
fastened by straw bands. Often there are no
chimneys.</p>

<p>We stop at the town of Dugort under the shadow
of the sombre mountain, "Slievemore," which rises
immediately behind it. The town is an attempt
on the part of one church to upset the authority of
another amongst these people, and judging by the
absolute desolation of the place I should say that
the move has not been successful. There are
some good houses and a church, but the people
do not appear to be about. In the dreary hotel,
we spent some time in an inspection of the most
marvellous collection of paintings it has ever
been our misfortune to examine. There were
several of them and they occupied most of the
hallway. We were unable to discover what one
of them was intended to portray. We asked
the barmaid and she seemed equally in doubt.
B. suggested the mountain of Slievemore&mdash;I
thought, a leg of mutton. The artist is the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
hotel proprietor. We left a request that he
would "Please not do it again" which seemed
greatly to relieve the young woman in charge.</p>

<p>At the door stands a jaunting-car waiting to
take the luggage of a man, who has been fishing
hereabouts, to the station. We offer him a
lift in our motor and I tell the barmaid to
give a glass of whiskey to his car driver.
It appears, when it comes, to be a fair sized
drink, but the old chap cocks his eye first on it
and then at me, remarking, as he touches his cap,
"And did ye say, sir, it was <i>twelve</i> years old&mdash;indade
thin it's <i>small</i> for its <i>age</i>." As we roll off
he promises to pick us up when our car breaks
down as he knows it <i>will</i>. If that is to occur it is
well to start, as we are miles from Mallaranny and
well know that aside from this dreary hotel no
hospitality would or could be offered us in this
desolate region, and that the feeling here is not,
especially after the "day off," of the best, as is
proven by the curses hurled at us once more by
the old gentleman whom we encountered on our
way out. Later we meet the load of timbers and
find that the drunken man has been deposited face
down on the top, while his poor wife and old father
trudge along behind.</p>

<p>How different all here from the Ireland decked
out for the tourist! How sad and stern and
strange! As I turn to look back upon it the daylight
departs and the shadows grow blacker and
deeper, only the waters of the lake catching for an
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
instant a fleeting glow which soon dies out into
ashes; and with the coming of night silence and
solitude, profound and unbroken, rest upon the
island of Achill.</p>

<p>Yet there we saw some wonderfully beautiful
women, women whose type has made Ireland
famous, great blue-grey eyes and jet black hair,&mdash;or
the fairest of blondes with pale yellow hair and
blue eyes, like the rain-washed heaven of their
native land. Again, as we rolled by some white-walled,
rose embowered cottage, an ancient dame
in high frilled cap would smile us a welcome, or,
as once to-day, I saw such a splendid young fellow,
whose eyes beamed down into those of his baby
boy held in his arms. There was happiness there.
He must have married "his Nora" and the boy
must have had its mother's eyes. Happiness,
yes truly, such as comes not often to the portals
of a palace. The man smiles in my face as the
car rolls by. In fact, nowhere in all the years of
my wanderings have I met such quick response to
a smile or greeting as in these wilds of Ireland&mdash;save
when drink, the curse of the land, had destroyed
the man; but always with the women one
has seemed welcome.</p>

<p>As for the pigs, they are so clean and so pink
that one imagines that they wear silk socks and
pumps. Do they walk?&mdash;bless you, no,&mdash;not on
holidays at least, but ride in state, and here at
last you meet and understand "the gintleman
phat pays the rint." I firmly believe they have
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
all been shaved. B. says not, not till after death.
But those were very lovely and complacent pigs.
I was only astonished that they were not riding
in motor cars.</p>

<p>After the desolation of Achill it is pleasant to
return to the hotel at Mallaranny. Owned by the
Great Western Railway Company, it is most comfortable;
a cozy fire before which a tabby cat is
purring greets us as we enter the reading-room
and we drop rugs and books with a sigh of contentment.
Dinner over, the evening is passed deep in
the history, romance, and poetry of the spot just
visited.</p>

<p>Probably in no part of Ireland does superstition
persist so strongly as in Achill. Many of the
legends are gruesome and cluster about death and
the grave. Many are beautiful, like that of the
swans, and there is one about the seals, which
they believe are the people who were drowned
in the great flood. Not until this world is
destroyed by fire will they be permitted to enter
heaven, but once in every hundred years they
resume their human shape upon earth, and it
was during one of these periods that an incident
happened which is still talked about in the
island of Achill.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"John of the Glen had fallen asleep. Now
the place he had chosen to repose in was for all
the world like a basket; there was the high rock
above him, and a ledge or rock all round, so that
where he lay might be called a sandy cradle.</p>

<p>There he slumbered as snug as an egg in a thrush's
nest, and he might have slept about <i>two</i> hours,
when he hears singing&mdash;a note of music, he used
to say, would bring the life back to him if he had
been dead a month&mdash;so he woke up; and to be
sure, of all outlandish tunes, and, to quote his
words again, 'put the one the old cow died of to
the back of it,' he never heard the like before;
the words were queerer than the music&mdash;for John
was a fine scholar, and had a quarter's Latin, to
say nothing of six months' dancing; so that he
could flog the world at single or double handed
reel, and split many a door with the strength of
his hompipe. 'Meuhla machree,' he says, 'who's
in it at all?' he says. 'Sure it isn't among haythins
I am,' he says, 'smuggled out of my native country,'
he says, 'like a poor keg of Inishowen,' he says,
'by the murdering English?' and 'blessed father,'
he says again, 'to my own knowledge it's neyther
Latin or Hebrew they're at, nor any other livin'
language, barring it's Turky'; for what gave him
that thought was the grand sound of the words.
So, 'cute enough, he dragged himself up to the
edge of the ledge of the rock that overlooked the
wide ocean, and what should he see but about
twenty as fine well-grown men and women as ever
you looked on, dancing! not a hearty jig or a reel,
but a solemn sort of dance on the sands, while
they sung their unnatural song, all as solemn as
they danced; and they had such queer things on
their heads as never were seen before, and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>
ladies' hair was twisted and twined round and
round their heads.</p>

<p>"Well, John crossed himself to be sure like a
good Christian, and swore if he ever saw Newport
again to pay greater attention to his duty, and
to take an 'obligation' on himself which he knew
he ought to have done before; and still the people
seemed so quiet and so like Christians, that he
grew the less fearful the longer he looked; and at
last his attention was drawn off the strangers by
a great heap of skins that were piled together on
the strand close beside him, so that by reaching
his arm over the ledge, he could draw them, or one
of them, over. Now John did a little in skins
himself, and he thought he had never seen them
so beautifully dressed before; they were seal
skins, shining all of them like satin, though some
were black, and more of them grey; but at the
very top of the pile right under his hand was the
most curious of them all&mdash;snowy and silver white.
Now John thought there could be no harm in
looking at the skin, for he had always a mighty
great taste for natural curiosities, and it was as easy
to put it back as to bring it over; so he just, quiet
and easy, reaches in the skin, and soothering it
down with his hand, he thought no down of the
young wild swan was ever half so smooth, and then
he began to think what it was worth, and while
he was thinking and judging, quite innocent like,
what it would fetch in Newport, or maybe Galway,
there was a skirl of a screech among the dancers
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
and singers; and before poor John had time to
return the skin, all of them came hurrying towards
where he lay; so believing they were sea-pirates,
or some new-fashioned revenue-officers, he crept
into the sand, dragging the silver-coloured skin
with him, thinking it wouldn't be honest to its
<i>rale</i> owner to leave it in their way. Well, for
ever so long, nothing could equal the ullabaloo
and 'shindy' kicked up all about where he lay&mdash;such
talking and screaming and bellowing; and at
last he hears another awful roar, and then all was
as still as a bridegroom's tongue at the end of the
first month, except a sort of snuffling and snorting
in the sand. When that had been over some time
he thought he would begin to look about him again
and he drew himself cautiously up on his elbows,
and after securing the skin in his bosom (for he
thought some of them might be skulking about
still, and he wished to find the owner), he moved
on and on, until at last he rested his chin upon
the very top of the ledge and casting his eye along
the line of coast, not a sight or a sign of any living
thing did he see but a great fat seal walloping as
fast as ever it could into the ocean: well, he shook
himself, and stood up; and he had not done so
long, when just round the corner of the rock, he
heard the low wailing voice of a young girl, soft
and low, and full of sorrow, like the bleat of a kid
for its mother, or a dove for its mate, or a maiden
crying after her lover yet ashamed to raise her
voice. 'Oh, murder!' thought John O'Glin,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>
'this will never do; I'm a gone man! that voice&mdash;an'
it not saying a word, only murmuring like a
south breeze in a pink shell&mdash;will be the death of
me; it has more real, true music in it than all the
bagpipes between this and Londonderry. Oh, I'm
kilt entirely through the ear,' he says, 'which is
the high-road to my heart. Oh, there's a moan!
that's natural music! The "Shan Van Do," the
"Dark Valley," and the "Blackbird" itself are
fools to that!' To spring over was the work of
a single minute; and, sure enough, sitting there,
leaning the sweetest little head that ever carried
two eyes in it upon its dawshy hand, was as
lovely a young lady as ever John looked on. She
had a loose sort of dress, drawn in at her throat
with a gold string, and he saw at once that she
was one of the outlandish people who had disappeared
all so quick.</p>

<p>"'Avourneen das! my lady,' says John, making
his best bow, 'and what ails you, darling stranger?'
Well, she made no answer, only looked
askew at him, and John O'Glin thought she didn't
sigh so bitterly as she had done at first; and he
came a little nearer, and 'Cushla-ma-chree,
beauty of the waters,' he says, 'I'm sorry for
your trouble.'</p>

<p class="pmb3">"So she turns round her little face to him, and
her eyes were as dark as the best black turf, and
as round as a periwinkle.</p>

<p>"'Creature,' she says, 'do you speak Hebrew?'
'I'd speak anything,' he answers, 'to speak
with you.' 'Then,' she says again, '<i>have you
seen my skin</i>?' 'Yes, darling,' he says in reply,
looking at her with every eye in his head. 'Where,
where is it?' she cries, jumping up and clasping
her two little hands together, and dropping on
her knees before John.</p>

<p>"'Where is it?' he repeats, raising her gently up;
'why, on yourself, to be sure, as white and as
clear as the foam on a wave in June.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, it's the other skin I want,' she cries,
bursting into tears. 'Shall I skin myself and
give it you, to please you, my lady?' he replies;
'sure I will, and welcome, if it will do you any
good, sooner than have you bawling and roaring
this way,' he says, 'like an angel,' he says.</p>

<p>"'What a funny creature you are!' she answers,
laughing a lilt of a laugh up in his face; 'but
you're not a seal,' she says, 'and so your skin
would do me no good.'</p>

<p>"'Whew!' thought John O'Glin; 'whew! now
all the blossom is out on the May-bush; now my
eyes are opened'; for he knew the sense of what
he had seen, and how the whole was a memory
of the old world.</p>

<p>"'I'll tell you what it is,' said the poor fellow,
for it never took him any time at all to fall in love;
'I'll tell you what it is, don't bother any more
about your bit of a skin, but take me instead of
it&mdash;that is,' he said, and he changed colour at the
bare thought of it, 'that is, unless you're married
in your own country.' And as all their discourse
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
went on in Hebrew and Latin, which John said he
had not a perfect knowledge of, he found it hard
to make her understand at first, though she was
quick enough too; and she said she was not
married, but might have been, only she had no
mind to the seal, who was her father's prime minister,
but that she had always made up her mind to
marry none but a prince. 'And are you a king's
son?' she says. 'I am,' says John, as bould
as murder, and putting a great stretch on himself.
'More than that, I'm a king's great-grandson&mdash;in
these twisting times there's no knowing
who may turn up a king; but I've the blood in
my veins of twenty kings&mdash;and what's better
than that, Irish kings.'</p>

<p>"'And have you a palace to take me to?' she
says, 'and a golden girdle to give me?'</p>

<p>"Now this, John thought, was mighty mean of
her; but he looked in her eyes and forgot it.
'Our love,' he says, 'pulse of my beating heart,
will build its own palace; and this girdle,' and
he falls on his knees by her side, and throws his
arm round her waist, 'is better than a girdle of
gold!' Well, to be sure, there was no boy in
Mayo had better right to know how to make love
than John O'Glin, for no one ever had more
practice; and the upshot of it was that (never,
you may be sure, letting on to her about the sealskin)
he clapt her behind him on Molche, and
carried her home; and that same night, after he
had hid the skin in the thatch, he went to the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
priest&mdash;and he told him a good part of the truth;
and when he showed his reverence how she had
fine gold rings and chains, and as much cut coral
as would make a reef, the priest did not look to
hear any more, but tied them at once. Time
passed on gaily with John O'Glin: he did not get
a car for Molche, because no car could go over
the Mayo mountains in those days; but he got
two or three stout little nags, and his wife helped
him wonderful at the fishing&mdash;there wasn't a fin
could come within half a mile of her that she
wouldn't catch&mdash;ay, and bring to shore too; only
(and this was the only cross or trouble John ever
had with her, and it brought him a shame-face
many a time) she'd never wait to dress anything
for herself, <i>only eat it raw</i>; and this certainly gave
him a great deal of uneasiness. She'd eat six
herrings, live enough to go down her throat of
themselves, without hardly drawing her breath,
and spoil the market of cod or salmon by biting
off the tails. When John would speak to her
about it, why she'd cry and want to go back to
her father, and go poking about after the skin,
which she'd never mention at any other time; so
John thought it would be best to let her have her
own way, for when she had, it's nursing the
children, and singing, and fishing she'd be all day
long; they had three little children, and John had
full and plenty for them all, for she never objected
to his selling her rings, or chain, or corals;
and he took bit after bit of land, and prospered
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
greatly, and was a sober, steady man, well-to-do;
and if he could have broke her of that ugly trick
she had of eating raw fish, he'd never say no to
her yes; and she taught the young ones Hebrew,
and never asked them to touch a morsel of fish
until it was put over the turf; and there were no
prettier children in all the barony than the 'seal-woman's';
with such lovely hair and round
blinking eyes, that set the head swimming
in no time; and they had sweet voices, and kind
hearts that would share the last bit they had
in the world with any one, gentle or simple,
that knew what it was to be hungry; and, the
Lord he knows, it isn't in Mayo their hearts
would stiffen for want of practice.</p>

<p class="pmb3">"Still John was often uneasy about his wife.
More than once, when she went with him to the
shore, he'd see one or two seals walloping nearer
than he liked; and once, when he took up his gun
to fire at a great bottle-nosed one that was asleep
on the sandbank, she made him swear never to do
so: 'For who knows,' she says, 'but it's one of
my relations you'd be murdering?' And sometimes
she'd sit melancholy-like, watching the
waves, and tears would roll down her little cheeks;
but John would soon kiss them away.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! much as he loved her, he knew
she was a sly little devil; for when he'd be lamenting
bitterly how cute the fish were grown, or anything
that way, she'd come up and sit down by him, and
lay her soft round cheek close to his, and take his
hand between hers, and say, 'Ah, John darlin',
if you'd only find my skin for me that I lost when I
found you, see the beautiful fish I'd bring you
from the bottom of the sea, and the fine things.
Oh! John, it's you then could drive a carriage
through Newport, if there were but roads to drive
it on.'</p>

<p>"But he'd stand out that he knew nothing of the
skin; and it's a wonder he was heart-proof against
her soft, deludering, soothering ways; you'd have
thought she'd been a right woman all her life,
to hear her working away at the 'Ah, do,' and
'Ah, don't'; and then, if she didn't exactly get
what she wanted, she'd pout a bit; and if that
didn't do, she'd bring him the youngest baby;
and if he was hardened entirely, she'd sit down in
a corner and cry; that never failed, except when
she'd talk of the skin&mdash;and out and out, she never
got any good of him about it&mdash;at all! But there's
no end of female wit; they'll sit putting that and
that together, and looking as soft and as fair-faced
all the while as if they had no more care
than a blind piper's dog, that has nothing to do
but to catch the halfpence. 'I may as well give
up watching her' said John to himself; 'for even
if she did find it, and that's not likely, she might
leave me (though that's not easy), but she'd never
leave the children'; and so he gave her a parting
kiss, and set off to the fair of Castlebar. He was
away four days, longer certainly than there was
any call to have been, and his mind reproached
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
him on his way home for leaving her so long; for
he was very tender about her, seeing that though
she was only a seal's daughter, that seal was a
king, and he made up his mind he'd never quit her
so long again. And when he came to the door,
it did not fly open, as it used, and show him his
pretty wife, his little children, and a sparkling turf
fire&mdash;he had to knock at his own door.</p>

<p>"'Push it in, daddy,' cried out the eldest boy;
"'mammy shut it after her, and we're weak with
the hunger.' So John did as his child told him,
and his heart fainted, and he staggered into the
room, and then up the ladder to the thatch&mdash;<i>It
was gone!</i>&mdash;and John sat down, and his three
children climbed about him, and they all wept
bitterly.</p>

<p>"'Oh, daddy, why weren't you back the second
day, as you said you'd be?' said one. 'And
mammy bade us kiss you and love you, and that
she'd come back if she'd be let; but she found
something in the thatch that took her away.'</p>

<p>"'She'll never come back, darlings, till we're all
in our graves,' said poor John&mdash;'she'll never
come back under ninety years; and where will
we all be then? She was ten years my delight
and ten years my joy, and ever since ye came into
the world she was the best of mothers to ye all!
but she's gone&mdash;she's gone for ever! Oh, how
could you leave me, and I so fond of ye? Maybe
I would have burnt the skin, only for the knowledge
that if I did, I would shorten her days on earth,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
and her soul would have to begin over again as a
babby seal, and I couldn't do what would be all
as one as murder.'</p>

<p>"So poor John lamented, and betook himself
and the three children to the shore, and would
wail and cry, but he never saw her after; and the
children, so pretty in their infancy, grew up little
withered atomies, that you'd tell anywhere to be
seal's children&mdash;little, cute, yellow, shrivelled,
dawshy creatures&mdash;only very sharp indeed at the
learning, and crabbed in the languages, beating
priest, minister, and schoolmaster&mdash;particularly at
the Hebrew. More than once, though John never
saw her, he heard his wife singing the songs they
often sung together, right under the water; and
he'd sing in answer, and then there'd be a sighing
and sobbing. Oh! it was very hard upon John,
for he never married again, though he knew he'd
never live till her time was up to come again upon
the earth even for twelve hours; but he was a
fine moral man all the latter part of his life&mdash;as
that showed."</p>

<p class="pmb3">As I close my book and put out my candle for
the night the moonlight streaming in at the window
draws me to the casement. The bay is like
a sheet of quivering silver with the mountains of
Achill and the island of Clare towering darkly
above it. On the highway winding off white in
the clear light no sign of life is visible and but for
the softly sobbing winds, the silence of the night
is intense. The tide is flowing to the sea and the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>
waters are deserted save for one slowly drifting
boat. One is scarcely conscious at first of any
sound other than that of the winds but, as the
boat draws nearer on the air floats upward one of
those sad crooning melodies of these people&mdash;at
first a low monotone which rises and rises, wailing
all around and far above until the very mountains
seem to throw back the sorrow of it. Then it
falters away into silence.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">Monastery of Burrishoole&mdash;Queen Grace O'Malley and Her
Castle of Carrig-a-Hooly&mdash;Her Appearance at the
Court of Elizabeth&mdash;Dismissal of Her Husband&mdash;Wild
Scenery of the West Coast&mdash;The Ancient Tongue&mdash;Recess&mdash;Kylemore
Castle&mdash;Crazy Biddy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Leaving Mallaranny we retrace our route
towards Newport and pass near Burrishoole,
the ruined monastery of the Dominicans, and then
the castle of Carrig-a-Hooly, from whence that
Amazon Queen of this section and of the island of
Clare, Grace O'Malley, dismissed her lord and
husband of a year's standing.</p>

<p>Carrig-a-Hooly is to-day a square pile of very
solid construction, standing upon a rock, and at
one time protected by a massive surrounding wall.
The few windows or loopholes are far apart and
very narrow. From which one Queen Grace
dismissed her approaching lord is not related
but that the dismissal was short, sharp, and to the
point, effective, there seems no doubt, as she
continued to hold sway over all the County of
Mayo and the adjoining islands, to say nothing
of as much of the neighbouring counties as she
could cowe into submission.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span></p>

<p>The monastery of Burrishoole is said to have
been her burial-place, and there her skull was for
a long time preserved as a precious relic, but it is
also stated that, together with those of many
others buried there, her bones were stolen and
being carted to Scotland were ground up for
manure, enriching the land as those of Cæsar were
used to stop the chinks and keep the wind away.</p>

<p>It was well for the thieves here that they worked
and escaped in the night, for such desecration
would have resulted in their quick dispatch had
the superstitious peasantry caught them.</p>

<p>Many of the latter believe that the skull of the
Queen was miraculously restored to its niche in
the abbey, but if so it has mouldered into dust
long since.</p>

<p>The skulls still to be seen here are regarded with
deep veneration and are often borrowed by the
peasantry to boil milk in, which being served to
the sick one is a sure antidote for all ills.</p>

<p>Queen Grace of Mayo strongly reminds one of
another Queen in a far-off country,&mdash;Tamara,
whose ruined "Castle of Roses" still keeps watch
over the Caucasus.</p>

<p>This castle of Queen Grace, like so many old
towers, is supposed to cover buried treasures,
guarded at night by a mounted horseman.</p>

<p>There is, however, another scene in her life
which, whilst not productive of such results as
the one at Carrig-a-Hooly, must have been picturesque
and startling in the extreme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>Imagine the court of the great Elizabeth, with
the daughter of Henry VIII. on the throne in all
the heyday of her fuss and feathers, robed gorgeously
and wearing a great farthingale&mdash;beneath
the hem of her short skirt one notes the jewelled
buckles on her high-heeled shoes,&mdash;from her pallid
face flash a pair of reddish eyes and above her
pallid brow her red hair is piled high and adorned
with many of the pearls and jewels which have
come into her possession from the robbery of her
Scottish prisoner by the rebel lords. Huge butterfly
wings of gauze rise from the shoulders but give
nothing ethereal to the appearance of the sovereign,&mdash;Elizabeth
was of the earth earthy. Around
her are grouped all the splendid of that golden
age,&mdash;the grave prime minister, Cecil Burleigh,
the gallant Leicester, the boy Essex, the splendid
Sir Philip Sidney, together with all the foreign
diplomats and beautiful women of the court.</p>

<p>In the space before her stands an equally imperious
figure,&mdash;the sovereign of this island of
Clare. What could have been her dress in those
days three hundred years agone? How did they
robe the dames of high estate in Ireland then, I
wonder, and must continue to wonder, for there
is no account left us, but I am sure she was a
beauty with fair skin, brown eyes and a glory of
red gold hair.</p>

<p>The Queen of England has just offered to make
her a countess, and we can imagine the half
amazed and wholly amused expression of her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
majestic countenance when the offer is coolly
refused with the remark that "I consider myself
just as great a Queen as your Majesty."</p>

<p>Then the Irishwoman went home and did
things, short, sharp, and to the point, effective:
secured possession of all the fortified castles
of the island and all the treasures and men at
arms, and there occurred that dismissal already
recorded.</p>

<p>It had been agreed on her marriage that either
party could terminate the matrimonial arrangement
at a year's end by a simple announcement
to the other. On the day in question the countess
observed from one of the loopholes of Carrig-a-Hooly
the approach of her liege lord, and thereupon,
to surely forestall such action on his part,
hailed him and announced that "all was off" between
them, making no mention of a return of
any of the castles, men, or treasures be they his or
not. She should have been Queen of Scotland.
She would promptly have settled the cases of each
and every rebel lord from Moray down, and John
Knox would have heard a truth or two which
would have made his ears tingle,&mdash;neither could
her Majesty of England have meddled so easily
in the affairs of the northern kingdom.</p>

<p class="pmb3">As our car rolls onward round the bay towards
Louisburgh, her island of Clare blocks the entrance
to the westward. Rearing sharply its cliffs
against a glittering sky, it strongly reminds one of
the island of Capri and occupies about the same
relative position here as that island does in the
bay of Naples.</p>

<p>But the blue of these northern waters is to my
thinking vastly different from that in the South.
There is a sensuous cast to all the colouring around
Naples, whilst here both heaven and sea are of
a bright fair rain-washed blue. The air is full of
health and life, the waters sparkle, and the strong
winds force one to jam a cap down over the eyes
and go for a brisk walk or sail, returning ravenous
for one's dinner; whilst in the south</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"With dreamful eyes my spirit lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the walls of Paradise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And one's body is very apt to contract a fever
during the trance.</p>

<p>Personally in Naples, with all its charm and interest,
I always feel that death stalks wide, the
mortal part of me is forever in evidence. Here,
a new lease of life and health comes with every
intake of the glorious air.</p>

<p>The winds blow strongly to-day while over the
mountains dense black clouds gloom, through
whose shadows one brilliant shaft of sunlight
strikes a white sail far out at sea.</p>

<p>On the rocks the kelp gatherers are abroad with
their long rakes, gathering a slimy harvest. What
a living thing that kelp seems to be. How quiet
its slumbers in the dark pool of the rocks while
the waters are afar out, but watch it when the
tide turns. At the first ripple it startles into life
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
and reaches out its long snake-like feelers towards
the coming sea.</p>

<p>Leaving the ocean for a time and turning inland,
we pass some bad roads, but finally mount upward
until in the heart of the mountains and the wildest
section of Connemara their surface becomes
smoother and the wings come out on our hubs and
the car skims birdlike onward.</p>

<p>Fortunately the day has become divine and
sunlight and shadow chase each other in fascinating
lights and shadows over the mountains. Up
in the higher valleys where the white cottages
are few and far between, the vast black turf fields
stretch to where the brown mountains rise to the
blue skies. Here and there the scarlet skirt of a
peasant woman at work in a distant field glows
against the brown earth, while donkey carts, each
with a solitary old dame perched on a pile of turf,
pass us now and then, the little beast which draws
them paying us no attention, save by a pointing of
the ears. This is not a holy day, so there are no
fairs and fewer cattle on the highroads, hence fewer
races, though now and then we do have a spirited
brush, and several old women shake their fists at
us as we pass by. Coasting down the hills which
surround the lovely lake of Doo Lough, we
come finally down by the shores of the harbour
of Killary or Killary Bay, where the fleets of
the nation may and do enter far inland in
safety.</p>

<p>Lunching at Leenane in a comfortable and clean
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
inn made an already pleasant day seem all the
more enjoyable.</p>

<p>The road, from Leenane on, lay westward by the
waters of the Sound, and then south and up until
a superb panorama of sea and land was spread out
before us.</p>

<p>Those who go yearly to some genteel watering
place know little of the outer sea, never comprehend
the majesty of the ocean as it rolls in on
Ireland's western coast, a vast wash of wild waters,
glorious and majestic, roaring around jagged
cliffs, which appear actually at war with it, while
the winds murmuring over bogs and lowlands
one instant are in the next roaring outward to
greet the ocean. All around here there is no
sound of human life, and a strange sad sort of
sunlight falls over the mountains and shimmers
downward into the sea.</p>

<p>The desolation of this coast is intense to-day
but how far more terribly desolate it must
have appeared to the poor sailors on those hulking
ships of the Armada, hurled to their destruction
hereabouts. I doubt not but that the last
thoughts of the poor wretches as they sank in
these thundering surges were of the vine-clad
sunny hills of far Andalusia with the tinkling of
guitars and the music of the Danza they were
never again to hear.</p>

<p>As we leave the sea and turn again inward, the
scenery becomes wild in the extreme. Sombre
mountains surround lonely valleys with here and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>
there a lonely lake reflecting the sky. The roads
on the whole are good, save for many ridges formed
by the backbone of the old stone bridges. If the
car does not slow down one is thrown out of one's
seat, and some of these ridges would destroy if
passed at full speed.</p>

<p>The higher we mount the more joyous the motion
until we seem to be skimming like a swallow.
One nasty angle almost causes our undoing, but it
is passed in safety by the quick action of our
chauffeur, who certainly understands well how
to handle a motor, though I think he was thoroughly
frightened that time; we came very near
shooting down into the lake.</p>

<p>Orders are strict that no risk of destroying animals
is to be run unless the safety of the car necessitates
it, but to-day we did kill a poor pussy who
jumped from a wall directly in our path, and not
a yard away. It was done in a flash, and kitty's
joyous days were over. Poor thing! as with us
life was the best she had, and it is gone. The incident
quite clouded the day for some time.</p>

<p class="pmb3">At another time a fine dog, a collie, sprang at
us and was thrown down and the motor passed
over him. I looked back, quite expecting to see
his mangled body lying on the highway, but instead
of that saw him take a stone wall in a fashion
creditable to the best hunter in Ireland, and none
the worse for his experience. But that does not
often occur.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>It does not strike the traveller as singular that&mdash;while
English is spoken by all&mdash;he hears so
much of the ancient tongue in remote sections;
there is the natural home for it: but I confess I was
much astonished during a recent visit to Canada
to find that, after one hundred and fifty years,
from Montreal east, French is the language of the
people. While in the larger cities English is of
course spoken, it is not the prevailing tongue,
and in all the small towns and rural districts
French is the tongue, and thousands of the people
cannot speak English at all. In one of the greater
cities if a man would obtain a position in the police
or fire departments he must be able to read, write,
and speak French, but a Frenchman is <i>not</i> obliged
to read, write, and speak English. All the estimates
for public improvements are in French
alone, though the bidders are all English or
Americans, generally the latter. Of course, they
must be translated into English by the bidders,
and what an opportunity is here presented for
breaking a contract by a claim of incorrect translation.
In fact, it would seem to an outsider
that Canada is much more loyal to France than
to England, even after a century and a half of
Saxon rule. Giving due allowance to the treaty
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
with France and to the power of the Church of
Rome, such a state of affairs at this date is
singular to say the least.</p>

<p>As for the attempt in Ireland to revive the
ancient Celtic amongst these people, personally I
do not think it will be successful, nor do I understand
the move; while it is well to keep it alive
for students and savants, what possible good can
it serve the desperately poor and ignorant of the
land, how can they use it? At least so it appears
to a looker-on. (I have not been able to extract a
good reason for the move from any of its many
advocates with whom I have conversed on this
tour.)</p>

<p>Surely English is destined to be the language of
men, not only in Ireland but all over the world, and
to my thinking this is the greatest work accomplished
by that nation. After all, is it not a case
of the survival of the fittest, and can any one
deny that that tongue is already the most widely
spoken and more rapidly spreading than any or
all others?</p>

<p>Go where you will you will find that next to
the language of each country it is the one in use,
and I believe that in generations to come it will
wipe out all the trouble caused by the inhabitants
of Babylon in their desire to get above high-water
mark.</p>

<p>For professors and students it would be well to
maintain these ancient tongues as long as possible,
but surely the poor of Ireland could be benefited
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
to a greater degree by other means than an attempt
to restore to daily use the ancient, almost forgotten,
and fast dying tongue of their forefathers.</p>

<p>As for the travellers in this land to-day it is
confusing and irritating to be confronted by a
sign-post of absolutely no value, intelligible only
to those who know the Celtic tongue. The peasants
cannot read them and do not require them,
hence, to all concerned, they mean as much here
as the verst posts do to a stranger in Russia.</p>

<p>As for the milestones, they tell a story hereabouts
concerning what happened between two
towns separated some eighteen miles from each
other. The figures on the stones having become
almost obliterated by time and weather an order
was given to a workman in one of the towns to
recut the lot. He took them up one by one and
placed them in the proper order in his stoneyard,
but when completed it is evident that, before the
work of replacing them began, he must have celebrated
the event in the usual manner. Certainly
the fact remains that he began at the wrong
end of the pile, placing the one marked "17"
where the first stone should have been, and so on
with the lot, the result being that sundry gentlemen
the worse for wear coming from one town discovered
that their utmost endeavours to reach home
only took them farther afield&mdash;where they finally
brought up is not related. As for the man from
the other town, when at the end of the first mile
"17" stared at him from the stone he became
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
convinced that the devil was after him and shook
his first at a solitary magpie which had just flown
over his head. I must confess that I doubt these
tales. However but for our maps we should have
been completely astray in western Ireland for all
the use the sign-posts were to us.</p>

<p>There is a charming little town at Recess, but
unless you are a sportsman, not much of interest.</p>

<p>Letters from home necessitate B.'s return, and
we must call at Kylemore Castle before we start.
Distanced from Recess some thirteen miles, a
journey thither and back would with horses necessitate
a whole day's time, but with a motor it's only
just around the block so to speak.</p>

<p>The morning is sunny and fair, and we drink in
the rushing sea-breeze as we roll away over gentle
hills and valleys between the higher mountains,
and though the hills are treeless the whole panorama
is attractive.</p>

<p>Our driver reports his petrol low, with none to
be had at Recess, hence we must fill the tank at
Kylemore sufficiently to get us to Galway if it
can be done.</p>

<p>Kylemore Castle stands in a sheltered valley close
by the sea though not in view of it. It faces a
lovely lake and is really built on the side of the
mountain which rises directly behind it to the
height of two thousand feet.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Across the lake the view is blocked by a similar
range. While the shrubbery is fine and the grass
very luxuriant and green around the mansion,
all the hills and mountains are absolutely
treeless.</p>

<p>The place, but lately purchased by the Duke
of M., was built by Mr. Henry at an expense, on
the estate, of a million sterling. Reverses forced its
sale, and it was bought by its present owner. There
is nothing ancient, the house having but some
fifty years to its credit, but it is capable of being,
and, in the present owner's hands, will be made
a charming dwelling-place, and certainly, swept by
the winds of the North Atlantic, it must be at all
seasons very healthy. Filled with a large company
or with a few congenial people it should be
an enjoyable spot.</p>

<p>Its gardens are very extensive and one passes
through endless conservatories full of flowers and
fruits. As we round a corner close to the stable,
we encounter the quaint figure of a woman with
straggling grey locks, tumbling down over a pallid
face. In a dress of rags and barefooted, she is
dancing a crazy jig all by herself. There are
weird gleams in her eyes as they rove over the
sombre mountains, seeking kindred spirits, I
fancy, as she croons in a monotone the notes of
some quaint melody which still drifts across her
brain. She shows as she catches sight of our
party that she is no respecter of persons as she
grabs the Duke by the coat and won't let go,
imploring him to "lock up the castle and I'll be
round a Monday." When he implores her to put
off her coming for a day or so she declines and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
sticks to "Monday." I cannot but doubt in
some degree her insanity, at least it has not destroyed
her womanly vanity, for when I tell her I
want to take her picture, she at once attempts to
smooth her hair and dress, and striking what she
thinks will be a becoming pose, tells me to "go
ahead," and after the snap remarks, "You had
better take another for fear that is a failure."</p>

<p>Yesterday, having gone to the kitchen of the
castle for her "bit of meat," she found a new cook,
who, not knowing about her, ordered her out,
whereupon she seized a knife from the table and
there ensued a handicap, go as you please, all over
the place, with the cook in the lead and Biddy a
close second. After that she got her meat in
peace.</p>

<p>As we return from an inspection of the grounds
she is being conducted off the terrace by the
butler. But Biddy has a mind of her own and
no one save this butler could get her away, if it
suited her to remain, which it generally does. We
are told she is deeply in love with him and that
there is a photo extant with Biddy on her knees,
clasping his legs and imploring him to marry her.
Now the butler is a most stately personage; he
has the cast of countenance of the great Louis of
France, the same beak-like nose and downward
sweep of the face lines running from it, the same
haughty pose of the head, in fact, deck him in a
high wig, court suit, and ruffles, and great red heels
and you have Louis le Grand; take them away and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
you have the butler, the object of Biddy's devotion,
to whom it makes no difference whether he
be king or butler. But Biddy in her rags is after
all the most picturesque thing about Kylemore;
her eyes are bright if she is crazy&mdash;but where in all
the world will you find brighter eyes than amongst
the beggars of Ireland, and they seem equally
pleased whether one gives or not (Biddy did not
beg, neither did she hesitate to take what we gave
her). Like all beggars, many of them are rogues,
but, ah, risk that, for you may by your half crown
relieve for the time real heart-breaking misery,
and such poverty as you cannot conceive of. Go
to Achill if you would be convinced of that.</p>

<p>Yesterday while watching a train pass at Recess
a boy approached and just looked at me, but with
a look of such hungry suffering that a shilling was
promptly forthcoming. Then I questioned him,
and found that he had been ill and could at best
make but a sixpence a day, that his brother drove
the car for the hotel, getting as wages only the
uncertain tips of the visitors, which, never many,
in this remote spot are indeed few and far between
in this bad season. His father had worked in the
neighbouring marble quarries, but pestered and
beset by a law-suit over his little hovel had, as
the boy expressed it, "gone dotty," and could
work no more. The mother did what she could
and a sister was a cripple. So that all they had
to live upon was what he and his brother could
earn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>Just as he finished a ducal train rolled by. His
Grace was transporting his family and effects from
one great castle to another. Surely the contrasts
in life are heartrending, yet I doubt not that this
Duke will and does do all he can to relieve the
sufferings of the poor on his estates&mdash;sufferings
intensified and made all the more horrible by the
unprincipled leaders of the leagues in this land,
and masters of strikes in ours and others.</p>

<p>But to return to Kylemore, the interior of the
castle at present is in a state of transition, so that
it is impossible to describe it. Built against the
side of the mountain, some of its staircases are
literally laid on the solid rock. Many of the rooms
are spacious and stately and in the hands of the present
owners will doubtless be made very handsome.</p>

<p>The glimpses of mountains and lake from its
windows are entrancing. On the whole I think
one might come to love Kylemore very dearly.
It has cost vast sums of money as it stands and
much more will be expended before the end, if
indeed the end ever is reached in these great places
where the expenditure of money is concerned.
This one will require a fortune to maintain.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Of the two Irish seats of the Duke of Manchester
I should much prefer Kylemore to Tanderagee.
While the latter is beautiful in its park and great
trees, the former is a place of endless possibilities.
Shooting and fishing are abundant and of the best,
whilst to the lovers of the picturesque the mountains
are an eternal joy, and close by is the jobling
and sobbing of the sea. Its quaint people are an
endless source of amusement and study. To enjoy
it one must dwell there, and I depart with regret
at our short sojourn or rather call.</p>

<p>Our petrol has run out and there is none in this
locality. However, the chauffeur manages to buy
some from the man at the station and with a
sputter and roar we are off and away through the
mountain glens, turning for a last glimpse of Kylemore,
and her little church, both gleaming white
amongst the forests by the lake, and guarded by
the brooding mountains.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a></h2>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt1 font08 pmb1">The Ancient City of Galway&mdash;Quaint People, Curious
Houses, Vile Hotel&mdash;Parsonstown&mdash;Wingfield House&mdash;Leap
Castle and its Ghosts&mdash;Ffranckfort Castle&mdash;Clonmacnoise&mdash;Holy
Cross Abbey.</p>
</blockquote>


<p>As we enter Galway from Recess, the roads
become anything but agreeable; there are
many crossings and bridge backs which throw us
from our seats, and without extreme care on the
part of the chauffeur would destroy the car. Fortunately
the weather is moist and there is little
dust, which in Galway is most disagreeable, the
soil being limestone.</p>

<p>If you would see an ancient Irish city, purely
Irish and undefiled by the progress of this latter
day, come to Galway, where she sits close down
by the sea. It is evidently to this section what
Paris is to all France. There may have been in
other times those of the upper classes here, but
they do not appear on her streets to-day. Narrow
and winding, they are lined with ancient houses
many of which bear pretentious coats of arms
and much carving, but all are now the dwelling-places
of the people.</p>

<p>The streets are jammed as this is Saturday
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>
evening and we move cautiously along. At one
point, owing to instructions from Boyse to turn
to the right and from me to go to the left,
the motor car almost runs over the pavement,
scaring a buxom dame half to death. "'Twas
the mercy of God the dur was open behint
us, or ye'd 'ave smashed mesel' and the childer
entirely." But at the same time she laughs and
gives us a "God bless ye." While we are learning
the route from her, a perfect Irish gentleman,
properly drunk, reels up and leaning over the front
of the car gazes at us in a most affectionate
fashion. Barefooted, rosy-cheeked urchins are
running in all directions, numerous women stand
around doing up their hair, and there is more of
the ancient tongue to be heard than at any other
point except in Achill.</p>

<p>As a child I learned a lot of it, meaninglessly,
from the old servants at home, and recalling many
phrases here have at times launched them forth,
generally with dire results.</p>

<p>To-day as we wend our way slowly through these
crowded streets, it greets our ears on all sides.</p>

<p>The quaint figures which one encountered in
America thirty years ago must have come from
here. Boarding ship in yonder harbour they landed
on our shores absolutely unchanged and unique.
One never sees them nowadays. Even in Ireland
they are to be met with only in the remote
districts; they are here in the good city of Galway
but you will look for them in vain farther east.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>The story of the first appearance of my dear old
nurse upon the streets of our city has become a
household tale with us. Just in from the "owld
country," she decked herself in her best for her
Sunday's outing. A gown of the most vivid
emerald green whose skirt spread over a voluminous
hoop was composed of four huge flounces
bound in bright red; a huge bonnet of green and
blue circled around her anything but classic
countenance&mdash;certainly her nose could never have
been called "Roman"; she carried an orange and
green sunshade. Her appearance created a sensation
which almost ended in a riot. She was too
much for the American youth as he was for her,
and she fled homeward pursued by a howling mob
of the gamins.</p>

<p class="pmb3">I must pay tribute to the women who have
come to us from this island,&mdash;respected and self-respecting,
they have proven most excellent
servants, with never a shadow of immorality
amongst any of them, thoroughly honest and
upright, and during months of absence, and sometimes
years, left in entire charge of the households
of which they kept as perfect watch and ward as
though they were indeed their own, and, in fact,
they soon learned to look upon the dwellings of
their employer as home, with no desire to change
unless to marry and set up their own firesides,
and even then they never have forgotten and
often return to the places where they lived so long
through days of sorrow and days of mirth, not
only servants but friends in the best acceptation
of that word.</p>

<p>While Galway is a town of but some fourteen
thousand people, the crowds on its streets to-night
would convey the impression of a much greater
population. They simply swarm all over the
place.</p>

<p>The city dates far enough back to have been
mentioned by Ptolemy, and probably took its
name from the Gaels or foreign merchants who
once lived here. Galway appears on the pages
of history in 1124 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> and from that date onward
it was fought for by every tribe of the island.
Just hereabouts there were thirteen tribes who
strictly guarded themselves against all intercourse
with the native Irish. Indeed there was a law
that "none bearing an O or Mac in his name
shall struttle one swaggere through the streets of
Galway."</p>

<p>But those days are past and there must certainly
be many who bear such prefixes to their names
who are strutting these streets in this year of
grace 1907.</p>

<p>This was one of the most important seaports
trading with Spain, and there may be seen, even
at this date, Spanish traits and features intermingled
with the Celtic, and many of its ancient
houses hold the touch of the South in their lines.
Galway was loyal to King Charles and suffered horribly
from the forces of Cromwell in consequence.</p>

<p>While there are quaint structures still to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
found in the streets they require looking for and
one must be prepared to endure much squalor and
dirt and endless smells which will not recall the
perfume bazaars of the Orient, though it has
always struck me that the perfumes of the Orient
were thickly strewed that they might drown out
much more horrible smells than were ever to be
found in Ireland.</p>

<p>The most interesting and famous of all the old
houses is that of the Lynch family whose façade
holds some curious carvings, notably that of a
monkey carrying off a child, one of the children
of the family having been saved from death by
fire by a pet monkey.</p>

<p>From the window of this house in 1493, its
owner, James Lynch, hanged his own son for
murder.</p>

<p>Legend and truth are probably greatly mixed
in the story told to-day. The murder was that of
a young Spaniard of whom the son was jealous,
and whom he stabbed to death. His mother besought
her kinsfolk to save him and them the disgrace
of a public death by hanging, the father
being determined that the law should be obeyed.
They met and roused the populace which collected
in a multitude outside the old house, to-day so full
of its noisy poor. The father, finding it would
be impossible to conduct his son to the place of
execution, led him to one of the great windows high
up in the mansion and from thence launched him
into eternity at the rope's end. The people, awed
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
into silence by his stern justice, dispersed in quiet
to their homes. To-day the street is called Dead
Man's Lane, and it is claimed that the tablet with
skull and cross-bones and its motto, "Remember
deathe&mdash;vanite of vanite and all is but vanite,"
was placed there to commemorate the dark occurrence,
but if so it was not until more than a
century had rolled by.</p>

<p>It is said that this stern, sorrowing father never
appeared in public after his execution of his son.</p>

<p>The family of Lynch appeared here from Austria
in 1274 and until 1654 was of great prominence;
then it vanished entirely.</p>

<p>The old house rises in state still from its squalid
surroundings and the gloom upon its face seems
to come as much from its present degradation as
from its sad history.</p>

<p>With all its dirt and squalor Galway is possessed
of greater interest than any other Irish city, though
with the hurried march of time in these latter
days, the antiquary must search more and more
each year if he would discover aught.</p>

<p>One of the most singular and interesting parts
is to be found in the district just outside the walls
and on the river. It is called Claddagh, and consists
of a colony of fishermen numbering with their
families some five or six thousand. Their marketplace
adjoins one of the city's ancient gates.
They are a well ordered and governed people,
having a king or mayor elected from time to time
whose word is law and from whose decision they
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
never appeal; neither will they acknowledge any
other authority. They are religious and will not
sail away nor fish on Sunday or feast day.</p>

<p>At one period they were sufficient unto themselves
and always married in their own set. That
is changed now and neither does one often see the
old and picturesque costume of their women,&mdash;a
red gown and blue mantle.</p>

<p>However, even to-day their part of Galway is
cleaner and more wholesome than its other
sections.</p>

<p>Its people are very superstitious and will not
fish nor permit others to do so unless the day and
hour be lucky. Some have tried to break through
this but were forced to give up the attempt, as
their lives were in danger.</p>

<p>An Irishman in the city stated that times were
very bad, they "had had very good crops and
hence could not raise the cry of famine and so
bring in the cash from England and America.
When they can do that every one is well off and
happy."</p>

<p class="pmb3">But, as I have stated, squalor, dirt, and evil
smells so abound that one is fairly driven off and
away from this quaintest of the Irish towns.</p>

<p>You may spend a time in her old church of St.
Nicholas, but if you enter the adjoining graveyard
the terrible neglect will drive you forth in
horror, a horror in no way quieted by a sojourn
at the awful railway hotel, a place so vilely
dirty that nothing save acute hunger forces us
to remain an instant within its doors. I ask the
waiter for a toothpick. "Well, really, sor, we
have none, but here's one of me own, which I'll
lend yez." In the search for it he pulls from the
same pocket a dirty handkerchief and a stump of
a clay pipe. My laughter brings a twinkle to his
eyes and procures us a much better luncheon than
we had reason, from the appearance of the dirty
table, to expect.</p>

<p>There is no excuse for this hotel. It is a
disgrace to the railroad which owns and runs it.
These railway hotels are generally cleanly and
well kept. Certainly such is the case in England
and Scotland and in the west and north of Ireland.
But in Galway the broken-down, dilapidated,
and filthy state of affairs is disgusting in the
extreme. One hesitates to eat anything which
comes from the kitchen, and we confine ourselves
to boiled ham and cheese.</p>

<p>From Galway our route lies eastward to
Parsonstown and had we followed the map would
have been simple enough, but the advice of
sundry home-going men, all somewhat the worse
for liquor, sent us astray several times, but in
a motor that is of little moment.</p>

<p>Parsonstown, or Birr, lies directly east of
Galway and en route we pass by Lorrha, where I
stop a moment to inspect its ancient abbey.
It is of interest to some Americans as having been
the burial-place for centuries of a well-known
family, the Carrolls. There are no monuments
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
or tablets, as dead have been buried upon dead
within the ruined walls for years on years, even
unto to-day, as a fresh mound with a half-withered
wreath of flowers upon it testifies.</p>

<p>Birr Castle was the original seat of the Carrolls,
but they appear to have owned numerous others
in this locality, such as Leap and Ffranckfort.</p>

<p>The life of the dwellers must have been very
crude and rude, but they were all very tenacious
of their right of sepulchre with their forefathers.
Each old will directs, after kindly returning the
"soul to the God who gave it," that their bodies
be buried "in the chapel adjoining the Abbey of
St. Dominick in Lorrha," and so it was done;
but, as I have stated, years have gone and other
dead have claimed the same graves in this holy
spot, until the place, now a tangle of ivy and wild
brier, is buried deeply and heaped high with the
silent sleepers whose rest is rarely disturbed by a
passer from the great outer world of the living.</p>

<p>In the surrounding graveyard the dead sleep
closely together and the spot is better cared for
than is usually the case. Apparently they are
not so soon forgotten, at least, one is not horrified
by the appalling desolation and abandonment
usually to be found in such places in rural Ireland.
Of course the people are very poor, but at least
they could lock the doors of the vaults and cut
the grass over the graves of their dead. It may
be that they consider that nothing is necessary
or can be done once they pass beneath the sod
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
of "holy ground," that, having been consecrated
by the church, any touch of man's hand would
be a desecration thereof. Be that as it may the
effects upon one from another land is horrible.
Such is not the case here in Lorrha, I am pleased
to state.</p>

<p>A quick run of nine miles brings us to the
quaint old city of Birr, just as the night closes in.</p>

<p>Birr is an eminently respectable town. Its
streets are wide and its houses have a delightful
seclusion which reminds one of the main square
in Frederick City, Maryland. There are arched
doorways shaded by climbing vines and bearing
great brass knockers. There are family cats
every here and there, and ancient dames peer
at you from behind lace curtains. In its main
square at the base of the column to the Duke
of Cumberland and his victory of Culloden, one
of the present citizens of Birr is declaiming. He
does not declaim long; truth compels me to state
that he is tight, and that even now two servants
of the law are escorting him into the calaboose.
Pity 'tis, 'tis true. But this is Saturday night
and a man must have his little enjoyments.</p>

<p>We descend at the door of an hotel whose name
sets us whistling, "Mr. Dooley's Hotel." I think
it fairly good&mdash;Boyse does not agree with me but
withal we are very comfortable in it.</p>

<p>Birr is the very centre of Ireland, and probably
takes airs to herself in consequence.</p>

<p>We arrive here very weary to-night. There
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
are days when motoring is not all joy&mdash;this has
been one. The lime dust and cold winds around
Galway have cut our faces into segments, and I
find a bath, an open fire, and easy chair too
attractive to resist, but Boyse has gone off in a
jaunting-car eight miles to see some friends and
arrange for a visit to-morrow to an ancient castle
where a real ghost still holds forth. We shall see
what we shall see, but it would take more than a
ghost to keep me awake to-night, much less to
make me drive sixteen miles to call, but it seems
nothing to Boyse who does not return until late&mdash;too
late to talk&mdash;and so good-night.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Morning dawns in mist and rain, which continue
off and on all day long. Birr is as silent as only
an Irish or English town knows how to be on a
Sunday,&mdash;every shop is closed, the houses show
scarce any sign of life, while Cumberland upon
his column seems to offer an apology for being in
gala array on the first day of the week.</p>

<p>Boyse's friends near here have bidden us to
luncheon after an inspection of that ancient seat
of the O'Carrolls, Leap Castle (pronounced "Lep").
So rain and mist defying, we roll off at ten <span class="smcap">A.M.</span>
leaving Yama and our kit behind us. The roads
are slippery and the car skids a little, but the
chauffeur is alive to the danger, which is minimised
to the fullest extent by chains on the wheels.
Some ten miles out we turn into a spacious park
and are welcomed at the door of the mansion of
"Wingfield" by the daughters of the house,
three lovely Irish women, and I know of no land
which can produce more beautiful women than
Ireland; striking forms, faces, and figures are the
rule not the exception in this land of the harp.
There is a type of reddish golden hair, fair clear
complexion, and sky-blue eyes which is especially
beautiful to my thinking; it belongs to the upper
classes, at least I have never noted it in a daughter
of the people,&mdash;there the dark blue-grey eyes and
black hair, or pale straw-coloured hair combined
with palest of blue eyes, prevail.</p>

<p>I have a painting by our poet-painter, T.
Buchanan Read, which shows the type I speak
of, yet where did he ever see it? Certainly not
amongst those emigrants who came to America
in his time. The painting, called <i>The Harp of
Erin</i>,<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> represents a white-clad woman chained to
a rock in the sea, whose waves dash up around her.
Reddish golden hair floats over her shoulders,
which are draped in a green scarf. Blue eyes of
the colour of the deepest heaven gaze mournfully
upon you and her arms are raised to play upon
a harp. The artist was in his happiest mood when
he painted this picture and for it he refused a
large price, expecting at the period of the Fenian
excitement, in the sixties, to have it lithographed
and so realise vast sums, but fate in some form,
how I know not, intervened, and his idea was
never carried out, or the Fenian bubble burst
before it could be accomplished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p>But to return to Wingfield. We gather in two
of the ladies and speed off over the slippery
highway to Leap Castle. Now Leap, I would
have you know, is <span class="smcap">THE</span> ghost castle of Ireland,
owning more spooks to the room than all the others
together. En route thither we pass under the
shadow of "Knockshigowna" or hill of the fairies,
and it would seem on this shadowy morning that
the ruin on its summit shows signs of a strange
agitation; perhaps the shades are aware of our
approach to their favourite castle in the valley
and trust that we may tarry until night falls and
their dominion maintains,&mdash;for until then, they
must stay where they are, high up on yonder hill,
which is the centre of all the fairy romance and
legend of the island. The forest is dense here and
we roll under the bending boughs, heavy with the
night's dew, and glittering in the sunlight. At
the end of a long green tunnel the tower of Leap
Castle blocks the way.</p>

<p>Leap stands overlooking a fair valley, a great
square tower to which have been added wings on
either side. It was one of the most ancient
seats of the O'Carrolls, who seem to have left
a most excellent memory hereabouts as expert
sheep-stealers. All of these ancient castles were
composed of simply one great strong tower.
Everything else is of much later date. We have
seen a dozen such in the past few days. Leap
is no exception. Fortunately its owner, Mr. D.;
is at home and welcomes us to what has been
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
in his family since the days of the Restoration, a
period when many of the Irish castles passed
into the hands of Englishmen.</p>

<p>We enter the lower floor of the great tower,
which in the days of the O'Carrolls was evidently
the great hall, where many of those weird, barbarous
feasts one associates with such places
must have occurred. To-day its appearance is
peaceful enough. Pictures anything but terrible
surround us and no ghosts can stand this clear
light of day.</p>

<p>From its windows you enjoy a superb panorama,
and from its terrace one of its ancient owners
leapt his horse when pursued by some enemy&mdash;hence
the name. He was a rider superior to any
even Ireland can show at the present time for the
drop is quite thirty feet.</p>

<p>The wings of the castle flank the tower on either
hand, but aside from containing cheery rooms
with much fine old furniture, are not of interest,
at least when compared to the hall, around which
a gallery circles in the second story, to which
stairs in the thickness of the walls conduct one.
In one of the angles there is an oubliette to anywhere
below,&mdash;in another a stair mounts to a
chapel in the top, dismantled and disused now
save by the ghost of a priest which walks here with
his head under his arm, and it is reported that one
of the chatelaines of the castle fled here from
following footsteps which she could not understand,
and flinging the great door to behind her
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
used her fair arm as a staple, only to have it broken
in two by a force no mortal could withstand.
She fainted, but before losing consciousness
saw passing by her the shadow of the headless
monk. If you sleep in one of those chambers below
there you will awaken to find your hand drawn
over the bedside and blood slowly dripping from
your fingers,&mdash;there are stains on the old oaken
flooring even now. Which ghost does that is
not stated.</p>

<p class="pmb3">No direct heir ever inherits "Leap," and when
misfortune is following fast on the footsteps
of the family, a ghostly sheep appears and with
a claw of great length (that kind of sheep have
"claws") scratches on the panels of the great
oaken portals. Every properly self-respecting
house in Ireland has a ghost, but Leap has more
than its share, and no peasant of the island
would venture to pass a night alone in the dungeon
under its great tower. There was nothing ghostly
about the very good Irish whiskey which we had
there,&mdash;so toasting all ghosts malign or beneficent
and bidding our host a thankful adieu, we depart
under the dripping skies and return to peaceful-looking
Wingfield, only to learn that it too
has its ghost, but a friendly one, being a great
white goose which walks around the walls of the
home park and so wards off all evil from the
occupants.</p>

<p>A cheerful luncheon with agreeable people will
banish any amount of spooks. It is so in this case.
Wingfield could never be called a lonely place.
Each of its fair chatelaines has a pet dog of her
own and there are half a dozen stray dogs belonging
to no one and every one. <i>They</i> are not allowed
in any room unless they find the door open and
in Ireland doors are rarely closed. If the dining-room
door <i>is</i> open at meal-time and they about,
it's first come first served, with odds on the
dogs,&mdash;ditto at tea-time,&mdash;in fact, any old time
or meal, and there are dogs enough to fill all
vacancies and be present upon all occasions.</p>

<p>It is a merry meal we have, but the best of things
must end and so we rise to depart. As I step
forward to open the door for the ladies I find the
knob gone and the act impossible; but we troop
around by another way and settle ourselves
before a bright fire in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>We are told by our hostess that the parson
came to call the other day. The doorbell was
broken but the door open. Upon entering the
drawing-room and closing the door the knob came
off in his hand. In the meantime numbers of dogs
had collected in the hall. Remembering that the
family were probably all out, he went to the bell
to summon help, when <i>that</i> handle came off also;
going to the window to get out, he could not keep it
up until he had called into service a small table;
thus he managed to tumble out on to the lawn
amidst ten or a dozen barking dogs not at that
moment on duty inside. He has not called
since.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>However to my thinking Irish dogs are good-natured.</p>

<p>Warm-hearted hospitality reigns in that house
and may good luck and happiness for ever abide
therewith.</p>

<p>After luncheon we start again with our fair guides
on a visit to another famous house, Ffranckfort
Castle, some eleven miles away, a veritable moated
grange owned by Major Rolleston.</p>

<p>Our way lies through the forest. There are few
hills hereabouts and no sign-posts to any of the
roads, so that one might well lose the route, and
but for our fair companions we certainly should
have done so several times since we lost sight of
the hill of the fairies and entered these labyrinths
of the forest.</p>

<p>Turning at last through an ancient gateway,
we see through the vistas of the trees and on a
level stretch of ground a great enclosure some
hundreds of yards each way surrounded by a
high stone wall, through whose pointed gateway
there are glimpses of a castellated mansion.
As we draw nearer a moat full of water discloses
itself around the outer wall, and rumbling over a
drawbridge which has long since forgotten its
function, we enter the enclosure.</p>

<p>As the car draws towards the house, which
stands in the centre of the place, a saturnine face,
with a long, hooked nose, gazes at us through
the dusty diamond-shaped panes of a window.</p>

<p>Here is a mansion of the olden times, and one
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
so secluded that few from the outer world ever
find it.</p>

<p>The house, built at several different periods,
stands in the centre of the enclosure. I should
judge that the main portion was of the date of
Elizabeth but the left still holds a large round
tower of a much older period and the main doorway
of heavy old oak, very thick, and studded
with nails folded back in several panels. A
very curious bit of work.</p>

<p>It would seem to-day that the gentleman
behind the window either doubts our being otherwise
than spirituelle, or doubts our characters,
and so declines to admit us, but he does come
finally, and we enter an old-time place which
knows nothing of the changes of these latter days
and cares less for them.</p>

<p>In a large square hall we are greeted by our
host, a typical Irish gentleman. He presents us
to the ladies of the family, and we are welcomed
as one is always welcomed in Ireland.</p>

<p>The owner, Major Rolleston, will not believe that
I am an American as he cannot "hear the voice."
I know just what he means and finally convince
him that America like England has many accents.</p>

<p>They are charmed when they find that I really
desire to see the old house, and we are soon at
work, at least the Major and I are,&mdash;leaving the
rest to discuss "tea." The Major acts as my
guide over the place and out into a lovely flower-garden;
he is greatly interested also in the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
cultivation of vegetables, and remarks with regret
"you don't care for farming." Confessing my
shortcomings in that respect his interest in me
dies out, and he shortly conducts me back towards
the old house, over another drawbridge, which,
like its fellow in front, has long since forgotten
its ancient usage. One might spend hours over
such a place and not exhaust its interest. I
understand that it is the only perfectly <i>moated</i>
mansion remaining in Ireland. There are fish in
the moat, and on one side a man can swim in six
feet of water for some hundreds of feet. The
portions of the building which we inspected consisted
of a large square hall, dining-and drawing-rooms
which stretch across its front, and a large
library in the rear.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The hallway, like most in the land, is decorated
with the antlers of many deer, and in the drawing-room
quaint prints and engravings and portraits
of long dead dames and squires adorn the wall,
while through the diamond-shaped panes of the
casement the leaf-flecked sunshine starts many
a face into life as it flits across them. One
feels that one should be dressed in the costume
of the Golden days.</p>

<p>Ffranckfort is not a splendid place, but it is
homelike and beautiful. Is it peace or stagnation
which broods over a spot like this? Do these
people live or merely vegetate? To a man who
has passed his years where the pulses of life beat
the strongest it seems at first like stagnation, as
though these woods must suffocate as they crowd
so closely around the outer enclosure, ever advancing
towards the house,&mdash;indeed one great
tree in its haste or intentness to get here has
fallen, and now projects over moat and wall and
far into the enclosure, where its branches peer
about them. Yet when one has been here a space
there is a "peace, be still" over it all, a sense of
brooding, that is very calming to one's spirit.</p>

<p>Everything belongs to the long ago except our
auto, which I order out of sight, round the corner,
with a command to stay there until it is wanted
and not intrude this twentieth century upon the
sixteenth. But we cannot remain for ever, and
the car, shortly summoned, glides forth and rolls
us off and away, through the great gateway and
over the bridge of the moat and so off into the
aisles of the forest whose trees closing in around
it hide the old hall from view as though by
the dropping of a curtain, and again I ask, is it
peace and contentment, or stagnation, to abide
in Ffranckfort Castle?</p>

<p>I think it was Bayard Taylor who, in his early
life, desired the seclusion of an island in some
far off southern sea, there to dwell in close communion
with nature, there to look from nature up
to nature's God,&mdash;but as his years advanced and
his sands of life ran towards a finish, that desire
changed to one which would place him where the
pulses of life beat the strongest, and his last words
were, "Oh, for more of this stuff called Life!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>The shadows of night and the falling rain
make it dark as we reach once more our quarters
in Birr where a bright fire in our sitting-room is,
to say the least, attractive, and where the discussion
pro and con as to the merits of "Mr. Dooley's
Hotel" are revived. "Beastly" comes from
behind Boyse's book where he sits reading deep
down in an arm-chair; but here is a cosey little
room, easy chairs and a bright fire, a dinner-table
attractively spread and an attractive dark-eyed
lassie waiting to serve us. May I never
encounter worse than that on my pilgrimage
through life.</p>

<p>To-morrow we go to Clonmacnoise and to-night,
as I sit reading about it, my thoughts become
a strange jumble of crosses and round towers,
haunted castles, and ancient Manor-houses
towards which I am carried in a wild rush through
the aisles of the forest surrounded and pursued
by dogs, geese, fairies, and ghosts until the top of
the hill of the fairies is reached and I am being
tried for high treason because of my doubts
to-day of the powers of each and all of them.
The headless monk is my judge while the sheep
with the long claw prosecutes the suit against me.
My fingers are dripping blood, it seems, and I am
about to be delivered to the dogs of Wingfield
when I distinctly hear it stated that I am
snoring and had better go to bed. Perhaps
such is the case; so good night.</p>

<p>As Clonmacnoise stands on the banks of the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
Shannon and is but some thirty miles north of
Birr, and the day yet young, we are off for a run
thither. The morning is moist and the roads
slippery, but we make good progress, most of the
way through narrow lanes, and sometimes through
pastures, to the astonishment of the cattle settled
for their noonday's sleep.</p>

<p>Clonmacnoise was once the Oxford of Ireland,
where the sons of the nobles were sent for education,
its name "Cluan-mac-noise" meaning "the
secluded recess of the sons of nobles."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>It was in addition, one of the favourite burial
places of the Irish kings. Even to-day, to be
interred here is considered a blessing, as those
so honoured pass straight to heaven.</p>

<p>The Abbey dates from the days of St. Kieran,
548 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span>,&mdash;he died of the plague and was buried
here,&mdash;and at one time was one of the richest,
compressing within its bounds almost the half
of Ireland. It flourished all through the wars
with the Danes, and seems to have been finally
plundered by the English, who carried off the
wonderful bells and every other movable object.
From that time onward the roofless churches
and buildings fell more and more a prey to advancing
time, until the whole became as we see it
to-day, a small ruined church, a fragment of a
castle, a round tower, and a stately cross, crowded
upon by the graves of those who have eagerly
sought this direct route to the realms of the blessed,
but, for us, this world is as yet too full of interest,
and we do not envy these dead even though they
have here found the portals of heaven.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>At Clonmacnoise is one of the many holy wells
dating from pagan days, and which the traveller
finds all over Ireland. These wells would appear
to have formed a prominent feature in the paganism
of the ancient nations. There are traces of
them all over Africa, Asia and Europe.</p>

<p>It's a slippery, sliding run back to Birr, which the
motor several times attempts to take backwards,
but it ends safely and we reach "Mr. Dooley's
Hotel" for luncheon.</p>

<p>It is a misty morning as we depart from Birr,
but mist at this season in Ireland falls like a
benediction upon man and upon all the world
of green around him&mdash;and where else in this world
will you find such green as in Ireland?</p>

<p>To-day the woods and meadows stretch away
before us and over all bends a grey sky with patches
of vivid blue and white cutting through it every
here and there.</p>

<p class="pmb3">We had arranged to visit with our hosts of
yesterday another of the "most ancient" and
still inhabited castles of this section, but fearing
a change to rain in the weather we give that up
and roll off to the south-west, until finally we reach
a fair green valley through whose grasses and
beneath whose bending trees lazily rolls the
river Suir, a river just wide enough to suit one's
fancy, full of fish and water lilies, and by whose
banks, amidst a thick grove of stately trees, the
ancient Abbey of the Holy Cross rears its grey
walls and delicate traceries.</p>

<p>Holy Cross is one of the finest ruins in all Ireland,
and was evidently an abbey of great wealth
and importance. Truly those monks of old knew
where to build and when they brought the relic
of the Cross bestowed by Pope Pascal II. in 1110
to this spot and erected its shrine, they made no
mistake. It is not difficult to restore in the mind's
eye the ancient structure to what it once was, or
to repeople it with the forms and faces of ancient
days. Yonder door in the outer wall must
often have given egress to the fat white-robed
abbot and his jolly crowd of monks, come out to
inspect the baskets of fish and other good things
brought by the people who crowded around them.
There were also hampers of fruit and vegetables,
and other things which looked strangely like casks
of wine. Back of all rose the stately abbey,
while the river flowed onward waving its lilies
and grasses, and the soft air was full of the sound
of sacred bells and murmuring waters.</p>

<p>To-day we face a stately ruin and there is no
sound of bells or sight of abbot, only the river still
murmurs amongst its lilies, but Holy Cross is as
beautiful in her ruin as she could ever have been
in the days of her splendour.</p>

<p>A comely dame admits us through the abbot's
portal, and for hours we wander as the fancy
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
dictates, pausing now in the choir with its ancient
tombs, climbing high on the great tower with its
prospect of God's eternal resurrection all around,
or resting where the high altar is draped in trailing
ivy and splendid with golden lichen.</p>

<p>The mists have disappeared, the sunlight is
warm and strong and one can almost see the fish
in the river, while the air is laden with the fragrance
of lilies, and there is a hush over all as
though this ancient dame were sitting for her
portrait.</p>

<p>How completely the rush and trouble of the
world drops away in a spot like this! How the
soul is lulled into slumber, and the "Peace,
be still" of God comes down upon one!</p>

<p>The usual dram-shop exists near this one-time
shrine of the cross and outside of it we found
a man somewhat half seas over who had insisted
upon showing us the abbey, but we were equally
insistent that we would not submit to such a
desecration, and so the good woman in charge of
it, with much pleasure on her part,&mdash;"the likes of
him, to be sure, to be troublin' the gintlemen!"&mdash;had
locked him out. He was on hand when we
came away, determined to get at least a sixpence
for a drink, but to all of his wiles we proved
insensible. Just before we entered the car he
moved off a pace, and regarding me from top
to toe remarked, "Well, I must say, sor, that's
the handsomest fitting coat I ever saw." As said
coat was a wretched production of a Chinese
tailor of Yokohama the flattery was too fulsome
and fell flat, upon obdurate ears, but he bestowed
his benediction upon us for all that as the car
rolled off.</p>

<p>This section would seem to be the very heart
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
of Ireland. There are traces of ecclesiastical ruins
everywhere, and one's interest is intensified
each moment until it reaches its climax some
nine miles from Holy Cross, when the land drops
gently into a vast valley from the centre of which,
rising some three hundred feet, and crowned with
ruins, towers the Rock of Cashel. At its base
clusters the town and in the spreading meadows
round about there are many stately ruins. As we
approach, the town gives scant evidence of life,
until one wonders whether any one exists there.
We certainly do not see a half-dozen living
things, men or animals, before we desert the car
and climb the rock.</p>

<p>It is a glorious day as we pass upward to the
hill and the old town and ruins take on a kindly
look under the streaming sunshine&mdash;for sunshine
"streams" in Ireland; the sky is never cloudless
and the sun breaking through sends its light
always in long streaming shafts, as though it were
a great searchlight directed by some giant power;
and so it is to-day, and just now it is turned full
upon the Rock until all the ruins seem quivering
with life.</p>

<p class="pmb3">But it passes, and as we enter and the iron
gate clangs behind us the whole place is full of
the sadness of decay. This was the Stirling of
Ireland for here is cathedral, castle, and round
tower.</p>

<p>The stories of war and bloodshed have passed
away and Cashel has fallen more and more into
ruin and decay with the flight of years. An old
guide, whose name does not seem to be given,
made it the labour of his life and love to restore
as best he could what was remaining. Here he
lived on the charity of the poor, which never
failed him, doing his best, and it was much, to
gather together the crumbling stones and replace
them in their old positions. Finally he died and
was buried here and his work, almost undone
by neglect and time, was finally taken up by one
of equal taste and greater power, Archdeacon
Cotton, who devoted time, energy, and private
means to preserve this most interesting spot in
Ireland from destruction. His work here started
in Ireland the same movement towards the preservation
of these ancient places with which Sir
Walter Scott was so identified in Scotland.</p>

<p>To both, the lover of antiquities owes an eternal
debt of gratitude.</p>

<p>Of Cashel it is related that Archbishop Brice in
1744, not being able to drive his carriage to the
top of the rock, procured an act of Parliament to
remove the cathedral down into the town, whereupon
the roof was actually taken off for the value
of the lead and the venerable pile abandoned to
ruin.</p>

<p>As we pass the iron gateway which now guards
the ruins and the dead who sleep around and in
them (for the whole is now a great necropolis)
the eye is first attracted by a rude cross rising
from an equally rude base; on one side is carved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
the crucifixion, and on the other a figure of
St. Patrick. Here it is said the kings of Munster
were crowned and here also tribute was paid by
those of lesser state, and it is claimed that a hollow
on one side was caused by the throwing down
of the tribute gold through many years.</p>

<p>Passing onward one enters the quaint Cormac's
Chapel, one of the most interesting remains in
Ireland. Its original stone roof is still in place
and possesses two very singular square towers on
either side, one of which carries its pyramidal
roof, but the other is open to the sky. The chapel
is not large, being but fifty-three feet long and
having only a nave and choir. It is Norman in
its character; the very rich decorations of its
arches and niches are all of that style.</p>

<p>The cathedral is, of course, a ruin, but stately
and beautiful. Its interior is crowded with flat
tombstones and even to-day interments take
place here, and be assured to have the right of
burial in Cashel Church is a hallmark of nobility
which no money can purchase; only blood ties with
those long since laid to rest will gain you a right
to sleep there, and the same holds with Muckross.</p>

<p>There is not much left of the castle. Outward
amongst the many graves which cover the rock,
the eye is at once attracted by the stately round
tower, rising a hundred feet above the rock. To
my thinking there is nothing more majestic than
these simple towers with their conical caps, and
one weaves around them all manner of romances
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
and stories, which probably are very far from the
truth.</p>

<p>There seems little doubt that they are simply
the campaniles of this northern land and it
appears certain that they did not make their
appearance until after the advent of Christianity.
They were probably used also for watch towers
and are to be found all down the coast at points
where the Danes were apt to land.</p>

<p>In those days the Danes were the marauders
of Europe, and Ireland did not escape their
attention.</p>

<p>The ancient annals of the island call these towers,
of which seventy are still standing, "Cloicoheach"
or house of a bell. There are two in the
land which have most impressed me, this one
high on the Rock of Cashel and the one at Glendalough,
deep down in a valley. Of that one
I shall speak later on.</p>

<p>Cashel as a place of importance dates from the
early kings of Munster and from the days of
St. Patrick&mdash;the fifth century&mdash;when St. Declan
founded a church here.</p>

<p>Its name probably came from a stone fort
or "Caiseal." It was also called the City of the
Kings. Here in 1172 Henry the Second received
the homage of Donald O'Brien, King of Thomond,
and the princes of Offaly and Decies, and England
became the ruler of the land. Here he read
aloud that famous papal bull. Edward Bruce
passed by Cashel and paused to hold a parliament.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
The Butlers and Fitzgeralds warred all over the
place and the great Earl of Kildare in 1495
burned down the cathedral, and when called by
the King of England to accounting, declared that
he would not have thought of committing such a
sacrilege but that he was told that the archbishop
was surely in the church; whereupon the King
exclaimed, "If all Ireland cannot govern this
man, he is the fittest to govern all Ireland,"
and thereupon appointed him viceroy the following
year.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The rock and town were given up to plunder and
slaughter by Lord Inchiquin in 1647 when twenty
monks and many of the people were slain, but
Cashel shines forth most brilliantly as the seat for
centuries of an archbishop, and as the stranger
stands on the rock to-day it is not difficult to
picture the scenes and pageants of that period.
Restore in your minds the church and palace to
their former grandeur, rebuild and repeople the
many monasteries which dot the green valley
around the rock, fill the shady lanes with the gorgeous
processionals of the Church of Rome advancing
to some great ceremonial in the cathedral
already crowded with a multitude bowed in
prayer, place the gorgeously robed archbishop on
his throne before the altar ablaze with gold and
lighted candles, while the sunlight streaming
through the painted windows casts the greater
glory of God over all, and the organ sends its deep
solemn tones forth under the stately arches.</p>

<p>Then you have Cashel at its best; but passing
outward your eye would have been at once
attracted by the stately round tower, as stately
to-day as it was then, which would tell you at once
that, as some believed, long before the cross came
to Cashel the pagans held their barbarous rites and
ceremonies on this rock.</p>

<p>Again, we are told that Cashel was first founded
in the reign of Coro, son of Loo-ee, and that its
name was Sheedrum, also called Drum-feeva;
from the woods about. Through the forests and
up to the rock at that time came two swineherds,
with their pigs, Kellarn, herdsman to the King of
Ely, and Doordry, herdsman for the King of
Ormond, and there appeared to them here a
figure as brilliant as the sun, and whose voice,
more melodious than any music of this world,
was consecrating the hill and prophesying the
coming of St. Patrick. The news soon reached
Coro, who came hither without delay and built a
palace here called Lis-no-Lachree, or the fort
of heroes, and being King of Munster his royal
tribute was received on this rock, then called
Currick-Patrick,&mdash;wherefore it was called Cashel,
<i>i.e.</i>, Cios-ail, or the rock of tribute.</p>

<p>All that is but a legend and story of the long ago,
yet this great round tower bears enduring testimony
that Cashel was occupied long before the
English invasion. Indeed the chapel of Cormac is
undoubtedly of before that period but the cathedral
dates from 1169, and the castle from 1260.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
The whole was originally surrounded by a wall,
of which no trace remains to us.</p>

<p>But after all it is the prospect from the outer
walls which will longest hold your attention, the
beautiful panorama of the golden vale of Tipperary
spread out before you, while beyond range the
stately Galty Mountains and the Slievenaman and
Clonmel hills, the old town clustering around the
base of the rock, its twisting narrow streets bordered
by quaint houses while the green meadows
around are dotted with ruined abbeys and many a
tower of far more ancient date.</p>

<p>If Ireland <i>is</i> unhappy, she does not show it
here to the passing stranger to-day. All is
peace down amongst those meadows and beside
those still waters.</p>

<p>Yonder is the Abbey of Horl, the equal of Holy
Cross, but to inspect all the abbeys one passes
would take a lifetime.</p>

<p>As we return to the car, I notice that there is
trouble of some sort. An old Irishman stands
near-by and a little girl is trying vainly to draw
him away. As we arrive Yama remarks that
the old man is insulting, and in as low a tone
as I can command I bid him pay no attention
as the man is drunk. That may be, but not so
drunk as to deaden his hearing for he promptly
replies, "Yes, sor, I am drunk, but I am drunk
on my own whiskey, and I am not travellin'
around wid a monkey man." It was well-nigh
impossible to keep grave faces, but for the Jap's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span>
sake we succeeded, and the car started, not,
however, without another shot from the old
man: "Well, good-bye to yez, and I forgive ye if
ye did say I am drunk." I am glad to state that
that was the only experience of the kind which we
encountered. What may have occurred before
we reached the car I cannot say,&mdash;I certainly did
not question the Jap on the subject, judging
it better to drop the whole matter, but I have
little doubt but that he did or said something to
enrage the old man. The only one concerned
for whom I felt any pity was the little granddaughter,
who vainly endeavoured to lead him
away. Poor child, her eyes were full of tears
and I felt very sorry for her. In this world of
ours it seems always her sex which must suffer.</p>

<p>Our route from Cashel to Buttevant lies through
rich meadow-lands where the grass is greener and
the buttercups of a deeper golden than anywhere
else in the world I think, unless it be in the "blue
grass" regions of our own Kentucky. This was
certainly the land of promise to all who lived here
or could force their way in; almost every turn
in the road brings us upon some ruined tower
or castle, whilst fragments of ecclesiastical buildings
dot the landscape far and near. Indeed,
as we roll leisurely along on this bright summer's
morning, the prospect is at all times enchanting to
the lover of history and antiquity, and the interest
increases steadily until Kilmalloch, the Balbec of
Ireland, is reached, though at all times the traveller's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
regret will be intense that the ruin of all is
so complete. In fact, the town is but a mass of
ruins where the miserable hovels of the poor
prop up what is left of the ancient mansions of a
vanished nobility. As we pass through what was
once its greatest street we note the remains of
stately houses every here and there, but they
have evidently been partly pulled down and their
materials used to build the wretched structures
which now shelter these people. Only the property
of the church has been spared and in this case,
though the ruin is great, it is the result of the
sieges during Elizabeth's and Cromwell's time; the
people have let the buildings alone, only that
great disbeliever in church or state, time, is for
ever at work completing their destruction.</p>

<p class="pmb3">One comes here upon the trails of the most
powerful family which Ireland has ever possessed,
the Desmonds, whose properties, covering four
counties, extended over one hundred miles and
contained over five hundred and seventy thousand
acres. An ancient family, even at that
period, they were made earls in 1329. Their
power appears to have been at all times dreaded
by the crown and we find one of them of the
Kildare branch a prisoner in the Tower in Henry
VII.'s time. He it was who burned the cathedral
at Cashel, hence we may save our sympathies
for a better man, especially as his assurance so
affected the King that he was appointed governor
of Ireland, as we related in the account of Cashel.</p>

<p>His son, for rebellion, did not fare so well
with Henry VIII., as, with five of his uncles, he
perished on the scaffold and his family was only
saved from extinction by having his youngest
brother smuggled over to France to return to home
and restored estates when Edward VI. sat on the
throne.</p>

<p>Do not, however, for a moment imagine that
that family "lived happily for ever after." Certainly
not with such blood flowing in their veins
and with Elizabeth Tudor wearing the crown,
during whose reign the sixteenth Earl of Desmond
did all he could to prevent his name from sinking
into oblivion. He became conspicuous as an
"ingenious rebel" and the Queen speaks of him
in one of her letters as "a nobleman not brought
up where law and justice had been frequent," by
which I presume her Majesty meant that he had
forgotten that the words "law" and "justice"
meant the royal "will" and "desire" only. We
have had some such forgetfulness in our own land
of late years. Desmond was of such power that he
could raise a company of five hundred men of his
own name alone, all of whom and his own life also
he lost in three years' time. There is little doubt
that he was driven to rebellion by wrong and oppression,
as he and his estates were objects of envy
to every other chieftain of Ireland. His greatest
enemy, the Earl of Ormond, was finally empowered
by the crown to crush him and in the
end succeeded. Desmond, "trusting no home
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
or castle," was driven to woods and bogs and
finally captured in a ruined hovel where his head
was struck off and sent to the Queen "pickled
in a pipkin." His executioner, a soldier named
"Daniel Kelly," received a pension of twenty
pounds from the crown but for some later act was
hanged at Tyburn.</p>

<p>With James, the son of this Desmond, the
power of the family terminated. He became
a Protestant and the only one of his name. It is
useless to state that the followers of his ancient
house would not tolerate such a lapse and upon
his only visit to Kilmalloch he was spat upon on
his return from church. That drove him to
London, where he died.</p>

<p>As I have stated, there is almost nothing to
remind the traveller through Kilmalloch to-day
of its ancient splendour, though he may still trace
its walls which once completely surrounded the
town. Just outside stands the ruins of the
Dominican friary, a stately empty shell.</p>

<p>Leaving it, we roll away southward and upon
entering the town of Buttevant are rudely shaken
from the contemplation of ancient days to the
activity of this twentieth century.</p>

<p>Buttevant is indulging in a horse fair where
David Harums congregate from all the land
roundabout. As our car rolls through the streets,
we are regarded as legitimate prey and have
horses of all ages, sizes, and colours,&mdash;"Sound?
Glory be to God, as sound as yer honour," shoved
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
in front of us. (That we pass on without pausing
stamps us at once as unworthy of further notice.)
One man with absolutely no right has seized upon
an adjoining field and after breaking a hole in
the wall as a ticket window proceeds to collect
a shilling from all who enter, of which there are
many. If any refuse to pay he seizes a convenient
rock and threatens them. It is useless to state
that most of the community imagine that all that
is worth seeing in the place is in that field, and
as every one crowds in there they are not far
wrong. Still, I learn later, the canny ticket
collector takes care to vanish at the proper
moment. They spend some time looking for him,
especially as the owner of the field threatens to
have the law on the whole lot for trespass.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Leaving the noise and confusion behind us, we
enter the great square of the barracks, and the
motor vanishes for a season.</p>

<p>These barracks at Buttevant are spacious and,
as barracks go, very comfortable. Situated in a
good hunting country, one hears horse and hound
talk intermingled with the many bugle calls
and the stirring sounds of the fife. The campus
or compound, a great green square surrounded
by the quarters, is constantly a gay spot, often
with lawn-tennis and cricket going on in its
centre, and there are always the officers' wives
and children, giving the scene just that touch
and charm which can only come from women's
presence.</p>

<p>Orderlies are leading or riding around the drive
the hunters recently purchased at the neighbouring
horse fair, and constant are the comments upon
each nag as it passes,&mdash;mingled with much badinage
at the expense of the purchasers.</p>

<p>The regimental band of fifty men discourses
sweet music. Tea is on in the mess-room&mdash;soldiers
in khaki and soldiers in scarlet coats are everywhere.
Snatches of songs come from the different
quarters and life does not seem hard to these
soldiers, at least not now, and yet&mdash;the call to
arms and the chance of a skirmish is always
welcome at first, until they realise that "War is
Hell" and once entered upon cannot be so easily
stopped. There is no thought of war here now
and life goes merrily onward.</p>

<p>At seven-thirty the dressing bugle sounds and
we are off to reassemble in the officers' mess at
eight for that most important function, dinner.

I confess I feel slovenly in my black clothes
amongst the scarlet and gold of the officers.
The mess dress of the army is very effective,
a scarlet jacket fitting closely and showing
a generous shirt front, dark blue trousers with
scarlet stripes, strapped over patent leather
boots bearing spurs,&mdash;a dress becoming to any
man. Once he knows you, a British officer is
always very cordial and agreeable; there are few
exceptions to that rule. I am certainly given a
cordial welcome amongst them on my first evening.</p>

<p>Dinner announced, we file down to the mess-room
where if you imagine things are crude or
camp-like you are mistaken. The spacious apartment
is adorned with the "colours" old and new of
the whole regiment (as this is the headquarters
of all its battalions and all such things are here
stored), most of them torn with the strife of
battle. The table, of Bombay oak (which travels
with the regiment wherever it goes), is of great
width and as long as the room will permit.
For dinner it is decked with magnificent plate
in the form of candelabra, cups and fantastic
salt-cellars, etc. There are flowers and snowy
linen of course, and the room is brilliant with
scarlet coats and the mellow light of wax
candles. The dinner goes merrily on, while
outside the regimental band discourses its best.
Towards the end we are brought to our feet with
"Gentleman, the King," and so, to the national
anthem, drink the health of his Majesty.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span></p>

<p>(I must compliment this band. It is excellent,
and I believe is considered the best in south
Ireland.)</p>

<p>After dinner, we adjourn to the smoking-room
upstairs, and "bridge" comes in for proper
attention.</p>

<p>Not caring for the game, Major Beddoes and I
are seated before the fire. The room is a large one
and, I am thankful to say, does not possess
electric lights; a shaded lamp throws a warm
glow downward upon the card tables while the
flashes of the firelight bring the scarlet coats and
gold braid of the players, and the tattered battle
flags beyond them into bold relief now and then.</p>

<p>The air is full of tobacco smoke, but aside from
our subdued voices and an occasional remark
thrown at me by the players because I neither
smoke nor play, the room is very quiet. Outside,
the barracks and the town seem to have gone
to sleep save for an occasional bugle call or sentry
challenge.</p>

<p>There had been some commotion below earlier in
the evening because of a young setter pup, which
Capt. D. had shut up in his room, having eaten
one of the Captain's new walking boots, and Major
Beddoes had some words with his man, whom
he had discovered wearing one of his, the Major's,
best dress shirts. "Sure, Major, 'twasn't soiled
enough to give to old Mag beyant there to wash,
and I jest thought I would give it a wear or so
mesell, knowin' ye wouldn't care."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span></p>

<p class="pmb3">But those incidents of barracks life have passed
on, when I ask the Major what he thinks are the
real feelings of the English for Americans,&mdash;do you
like us?&mdash;he is enough like a Yankee to throw
the query back at me with the parties reversed;
but I came first upon the field and insist upon
that advantage. After some moments of quiet
pulling at his beloved pipe, he answers, "I think
individually, yes,&mdash;as a nation, <i>no</i>, and you have
probably discovered that for yourself, and the
feeling on our part may be based on jealousy.
You are also aware that the same holds in your
own land toward our people. As a general thing
we like your women, but not your men, and our
opinion of the latter is probably influenced by
those of your citizens who have turned their backs
upon their own land and settled amongst us. Of
these I do not include those who have come
amongst us for business reasons,&mdash;they always
expect to go 'home,' and are at all periods of
their sojourn here Americans,&mdash;but those others
who, drawing their entire support from their
own country, settle here and become more anti-American
than any Englishman ever was. We
despise them, and no matter how hard they may
work for it, they will never be looked upon otherwise
than as strangers,&mdash;their children, reared
over here, possibly, but never themselves, for
whether we like you or not, we do think that
one born in America should be proud of that
fact and not a cad. Do you agree with me?"</p>

<p>"Assuredly, and personally whatever pride
in the past I possess is centred in those of my
ancestors who helped to make and preserve our
great nation,&mdash;beyond them, while it is interesting
to trace backward into the countries of the old
world, it is simply a pastime."</p>

<p>"You certainly send us funny lots of people
during the touring months."</p>

<p>"Yes,&mdash;but have you ever tried to talk to
them?"</p>

<p>"Just recall that lot at Mallow the other day.
Could any party on the surface be more unattractive?"</p>

<p>"You are quite correct, but if you had spoken
to that most aggressive looking man and his
more aggressive looking wife and daughter, you
would have discovered well educated and intelligent
people, such as form the real backbone of a
nation. They have consumed six summers travelling
in Norway alone, and thoroughly appreciate
that beautiful country. They believe that the
world is a better book than any ever enclosed
between covers, and they intend to read it, and
when the years bring old age upon them, all that
world will still be an open volume, its changes and
improvements fully appreciated and understood.
Can you not excuse much that is unpleasant
in people like these? And do they not compare
favourably with the masses of English of a certain
class found all over Europe."</p>

<p>As for the sentiments of one nation for another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
it is summed up in the words of a recent author,
"Moreover, the fine old dislike which Bretons
bestow upon everything outside Brittany was
hers both by inheritance and careful cultivation."
There you have it in a nutshell,&mdash;not only as
regards the English but all other nations. England
certainly holds that feeling towards all the continent
and I believe towards America; Boston has
it for all the rest of our land. New York has of
late years become more liberal, more cosmopolitan,
yet I heard but lately a man make the remark
in her best club that he had "a perfect horror
of the middle West." How does that sound from
an educated man in this twentieth century,
and of cities which have long since passed their
centennial? To be sure, far from being a criterion
for the citizens of New York, he was one who had
kept his nose down on the books of some counting-house
and had never left the confines of the city.</p>

<p>As for California, I have known the dislike of
everything outside of that State, especially Eastern,
to separate husband and wife and destroy a
family; where the wife's hatred of "outsiders"
extended from her husband's parents to and
including every friend he had in the East,&mdash;an impersonal
sort of hatred because she was stranger
to most of them, yet none the less violent, with
the result as stated.</p>

<p>Again, did not such a feeling have something
to do with our Civil War? Does not England
even to-day believe that the cultivation was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
largely in the South, and yet how unjust such an
opinion! I am half Southern, my mother's
family having been slave-owners for generations,
and I think I can speak without prejudice, and
I say again "how unjust such an opinion." The
cultivation in the South was sprinkled over a
sparsely settled country and centred in a few
thousands of planters and their families. In the
North, it covered all of a densely populated section,
and from ocean to ocean it would have been
impossible to find a class like the mountaineers
of Virginia, so ignorant that many of them not
only could not read but did not know what "reading"
meant. Furthermore where were, and still
are, all the greater universities and seats of
learning? In the North. Where did our great
poets and essayists come from? The North
again. I do not desire to decry the South,&mdash;far
from it,&mdash;but the old idea was an absurdity;
the South in her palmiest ante-bellum days sent
the majority of her sons north to be educated,
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Bridge in the meantime is over for to-night
and the group before the fire increased thereby.
So the talk drifts on and on. I am not given
to slang and do not like it, but I happened to use
a bit just here, "he monkeyed with a buzz saw."
Attracted by the silence which followed I looked
up to find every face gazing upon me in puzzled
amazement, until finally Major&mdash;&mdash; felt that some
explanation must be forthcoming.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monkeyed with a buzz saw? Now let me see,
let me see. What exactly <i>is</i> a 'buzz saw,' and
what happened to the monkey?"</p>

<p>My laughter forced them all to join in and
for the next hour these defenders of the British
flag took a lesson in American slang, until upon the
soft air outside sounded the notes of the "last
post" (or "taps" as we call it), the saddest bit
of melody in the world of music, and so "good
night," "good night." One by one the lights
went out and sleep settled upon the living while
the moon, turning her attention elsewhere, went
off to light the fairies dancing on the river and the
witches down in old Ballybeg Abbey.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The following day being Sunday the soldiers
of the King go to service in full dress; the grim
barracks are brilliant with hundreds of scarlet
coats and to the music of <i>Stars and Stripes Forever</i>
our one time foes move off to pray for peace
while prepared for war. I notice that <i>Hiawatha</i>
is the favourite tune for marching men, and am
told that it is not only because it is a most excellent
march but because the fife plays an important
part in its rendering and the fife is the only instrument
which can be heard above the din of battle.</p>

<p>There is a drummer in this band whose movements
are simply amazing, and I find myself trying
to imitate them with pole and cane to the peril
of life and property. How he does swing those
great sticks around his head and bring them
down upon that huge bass-drum! A drummer
surely whose pomposity surpasses anything of its
kind within my memory. As the inspiring music
grows fainter and fainter and the scarlet coats
pass away down the streets of the old town I turn
for an inspection of the barracks. On the top of
the entrance arch are the offices, on the right
the guard-house, and beyond it a large gymnasium.
On either side of the green and running at right
angles to the entrance are the officers' quarters,
while a large barracks for the men forms the
fourth side of the square. Back of this is another
square surrounded by large barracks, while the
married men have a separate building beyond
these and the Colonel lives in a retired pleasant
house off in one corner. Of that house and
the dwellers therein I have some very pleasant
memories.</p>

<p>To a looker-on in this twentieth century the
disregard of sanitary measures in such a barracks
as this is surprising and I doubt not the same
holds in all others of the Empire and perhaps
in all those of other countries, including my own.
Of that I am unable to speak, but the outrage is
an outrage all the same. One can understand
the lack of such things in far western camps
or in war times, but that a great stone place like
this with a hundred years to its credit should have
no proper baths or toilet-rooms for its officers is
"an outrage" most certainly, and one which the
nation should insist upon being promptly corrected.
There are a few bathrooms with good tubs and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
hot and cold water for the men but the officers have
nothing save the inconvenient, nasty little tin tubs,
and it is practically impossible for a big man
to keep himself in proper condition by their use.</p>

<p>These quarters are, as I have stated, massive
stone buildings. Each officer has a sitting-room
with two small rooms adjoining and so placed
that either of the latter could be transformed
at small cost into an excellent bathroom with
hot and cold water laid on. As it is now, these
gentlemen must use a little tin thing with an
inch or two of cold water. It's a common saying
amongst the officers of the army that nothing is
done for <i>them</i>. What the government does is all
for the rank and file. That the soldiers should
receive everything needful is in all ways proper,
but are not the men who lead them, the brains
of this strength of the nation, entitled to like
consideration? They offer their lives upon the
slightest cause, and gladly too, yet their government
is so far forgetful, not to call it by a harsher
term, that it neglects their well-being in this
manner. They are willing to put up with <i>nothing</i>
when it is necessary, and surely are entitled to a
<i>bare something</i>, and this is nothing more, when it
can so easily be done and at such small expense.
Cleanliness is certainly more essential to health
than many brilliant coats and much silver plate.</p>

<p>There is often scorn expressed for our bathrooms
with their modern appliances, but I noticed
at P&mdash;&mdash; that one of the scoffers, who might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
have had his little "tub" (so constantly extolled)
in his bedroom, waited and almost missed his
dinner that he might use the only bathroom in
that vast establishment. I do not desire to accuse
the officers of uncleanliness&mdash;very far from
it&mdash;but they should be better provided for in this
respect.</p>

<p>I am also astounded to note the treatment of
the common soldiers&mdash;"Tommy Atkins"&mdash;by the
public. In time of war he is worshipped, but
in time of peace is scarce considered to be a
man, merely a servant to be pushed and shoved
about and treated most discourteously, to say
the least. I saw this done in a theatre the other
night, to a soldier who addressed a simple, civil
question to the man next him. The reply he
got and the treatment he received would, in
America at least, have resulted in a row, and
justly too. However, that occurred in Ireland
where the "red coats" are not liked.</p>

<p>I understand that the pay per year of the
officers in the British army is about as follows:</p>

<p>
A Colonel,   £400 Sterling<br />
Lt. Colonel,  300<br />
Major,        240<br />
Captain,      200<br />
Lieutenant,   100<br />
</p>

<p>These figures do not seem very large when a man
offers his life to his country, but they are in excess
of many nations on the Continent, where the
officers are forced into beastly poverty by the call<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
for outside gorgeousness. At a late grand review
the eye of a beholder was attracted by an officer
quite resplendent in a beautiful white uniform,
superb high black boots with glittering spurs, a
silver breastplate, and glittering helmet, and
mounted on a splendid black charger, his appearance
was gorgeousness intensified. After the review
the observer, passing the tent of this same
officer, saw the entire gorgeousness as to uniform
hung up to dry and on the wretched camp bed sat
the man <i>with no socks on</i>,&mdash;"too poor to buy
them," all the pay and far more gone in the
useless display,&mdash;and yet not altogether useless,
for without the uniforms these great standing
armies would melt away like mist before the
sun and many a throne totter to its fall. However,
if the splendour must be maintained, and it is
certainly beautiful to look at, then those forced
to wear it and bear its expense should be better
paid, remembering at the same time that the
wearers are ready at any moment to stand up
to be shot to death in defence of the home where
you sit comfortably reading your paper&mdash;therefore
"PAY, PAY, PAY!"</p>

<p class="pmb3">The officers of these Fusiliers are devoted
to their cook. I suggested the other day that
his coffee might be improved,&mdash;it was wretched,
in fact, not coffee at all, while no fault could be
found with the rest of the menu. They replied
that they knew it, but he had been so devoted in
battle, had cooked under a galling Gatling fire,
had rushed so many times over death spots to
bring them hot sausages which he was forced
to carry in his hands, that they could not scold
him. I drank his coffee with great pleasure
after that. The heroes in this world do not
always wear the most brilliant uniforms and has
it not been proven that it is the commissary
which in the end decides the conflict?</p>

<p>There is nothing going on in the barracks
this morning which interests me, save perhaps
a court-martial, at which I am told that my
absence will be very precious. So I stroll off
in the soft sunlight through the great gateway,
where a sentry holds constant ward and watch,
just for appearance sake, I imagine, as it cannot
be to keep the boys in or strangers out, for just
at yonder corner is a breach in the wall unguarded
where any one may come and go at pleasure, and
I doubt not many of the boys do go and for
pleasure, though there can be little amusement
in the sad town which clusters between the
barracks and castle. Of young men it seems
to hold none, and there are not many children,
so that when these few old people pass onward and
enter for eternity yonder churchyard, old Buttevant
will wither away altogether. Many kindly
faces come to the doors to watch me, knowing
that I am an American, and their eyes have a
questioning look as though to ask for some dear
one in the land beyond the sea.</p>

<p>The place is indeed very old and every now and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
then as I pass through the streets I come across
some vestige of its past greatness and a mile
beyond its limits reach the ruins of Ballybeg
Abbey, in a smiling meadow down by the river
Awbeg. Something of a stately structure in its
palmy days, there is little of that left now, but on
the whole it is all rather sociable. The river is
of that sort, and having loitered downward under
its trees and through its grasses murmurs confidential
bits of gossip about the castle yonder
upon its banks. Yellow buttercups push their
heads upward through the turf which climbs to
the old grey walls of the abbey, and in the abbot's
doorway the white face of a ruminating cow is
silhouetted against the inner darkness. "They
also serve who only stand and wait," must have
been written of Ballybeg and its kind, for it has
left no trace upon the pages of history. Yet
withal, as I have stated, it's a sociable old place
and I spend some time in its company, seated
on the parapet of a neighbouring stone bridge
where 'tis said the fairies dance when the moon is
full.</p>

<p>I expected much from the name&mdash;Ballybeg&mdash;why
I can scarcely tell but I cannot say that I
am disappointed, though such stately structures
as Fountaine and Tintern in Wales would scarce
consider Ballybeg to be exactly "in their set."</p>

<p>Wandering up the banks of the Awbeg, I pass
beyond the castle. We had tea there last season
and a medieval castle which can descend to having
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
afternoon tea served within its walls is not
worthy of description. It is owned by an irascible
old lady who occupies one part and rents out the
other and who generally keeps such a strict eye
upon her tenants that it results in driving them
out. When we visited it the tenants were an
officer and his wife, and just that shortly happened,
so that on my second visit to Buttevant, the castle
stares at me with vacant eyes of windows, and I
pass onward up the river to the centre of the town,
where the ruins of its Franciscan abbey raise their
arches and columns and guard the dead of long
ago, and those who come in this later day to
sleep beneath its shadows.</p>

<p>If you enter its crypt, you will stand amazed at
the vast quantity of human bones piled pell-mell
there. Some say that they are but the natural
accumulation of departing humanity and others
that they all came from the neighbouring battlefield
of Knockninoss,&mdash;others believe that when
in the flesh they all lived yonder in old Ballybeg.</p>

<p>Be that as it may, they are here now, quietly
awaiting that day of days, which shall summon
them forth once more, and as I stand in the darkness
with my foot on a skull, which might have
enclosed the brains of an Irish king, downward
through a broken casement comes the sound of a
voice and the words "I am the resurrection and
the life, he that believeth in me, though he were
dead, yet shall he live," and I roll the skull
gently back into denser shadows, wondering,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
<i>wondering</i>, and then, as we all must do, ceasing
to wonder, and just continuing to&mdash;trust.</p>

<p>Passing upward into the sunshine and forward
amidst the long grasses which cover the humbler
dead, I find that one more has but now joined
this silent company, and those who brought her
here are slowly leaving the churchyard. Poor
people, all of them,&mdash;there does not appear to be
any others in this town of Buttevant,&mdash;but death
seems to hold no terrors for any one of these and
many sit round on the tombstones and do not hesitate
to discuss the qualities, good and bad, of
those asleep beneath them and to admire the
inscriptions. Here is one quaint enough surely:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies Pat Steele&mdash;that's very true;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who was he? What was he? What's that to <i>you</i>?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p class="pmb3">Yonder is a cross of wood under discussion at the
present moment. It states that "here lies Kate
O'Shea and also her sister Mrs. Mary Buckley," and
that as "their father died last year, this is the
end of the O'Shea family." That thereby hangs
a tale is very evident, and yonder fat old lady
on whose head a bit of a black bonnet is poised
and round whose shoulders a comfortable shawl
is wrapped could and would tell me if there were
not so many listeners about, who knowing her
love of gossip keep sharp watch and ward, so that
of those who are gone I learn nothing, but of
what is shortly to happen I hear more.</p>

<p>A wedding is to take place in the modern church just
here and we sit round on the tombstones, awaiting
the coming of the bride. There are hints as to
this bride which rouse my curiosity, and I decide
to await her coming, which shortly happens. She
is a comely looking young woman, modestly
dressed in a green gown, and a blue hat with
red roses thereon. Her blue eyes do not possess
a very happy look as they rest on the fat middle-aged
bridegroom, and the old lady on the tombstone
next to me heaves a sigh which tells
unutterable things. Still, all seems going smoothly
and we follow into the church. The ceremony
begins, and progresses as usual to that point
where the bride is asked if she takes this man
to be her wedded husband, when upon the amazed
and horrified ears of all falls the reply in sharp
tones, "Indade, I won't," followed by a swish of a
blue skirt and a flash of red roses down the aisle
and out the door and the bride is gone. I leave
a description of the hubbub which followed to
your imagination.</p>

<p>Getting finally outside, I find myself once more
near the old lady of ample proportions, and just
in time to hear her remark "and him wid nine
illegant fat pigs and sivin suits of clothes <i>aich
one better than the other</i>." This entirely destroys
my dignity and self-control and I double up with
laughter upon a neighbouring tombstone, whereupon
the old lady, after one look of grand amaze,
gives me "the full of her back" and with her
"nose trun in the air" passes majestically away.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
I learn later that of that bride they never again
heard. Like the bubble on the river she was
gone and for ever.</p>

<p>The neighbourhood of Buttevant is full of interest
to those who will turn aside from the usual tour
of Ireland. To-day we are off through the green
lanes for a visit to Kilcoman Castle, the home
for some years of the poet Spenser, and where he
wrote his <i>Faerie Queene</i>. We shall later visit
the scenes of that poem.</p>

<p>In 1586 Spenser received some fifteen hundred
acres of land from the crown, and on them stood
this ancient stronghold of the Desmonds, which he
made his home for years. Those were troublous
times and he saw much of their misery, and their
sadness tinges his great poem.</p>

<p>He received but small acknowledgment for his
work from Elizabeth, and even that was objected
to by Burleigh,&mdash;"What&mdash;so much for a song!"</p>

<p>This castle was sacked whilst he occupied it
and he fled to London, where he died in poverty.</p>

<p>The ruins rise from the midst of a green meadow
some seven miles from Buttevant, and consist
of a lonely tower, to the top of which we mounted
by its ancient staircase within the walls. The
tower chamber still has its roof intact, but at its
best the castle must have formed a poor abiding-place
even three centuries ago.</p>

<p>The prospect from the top is rather dreary,
and we leave the spot without regret.</p>

<p>Doneraile Court, in whose vast park were laid
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
the scenes of the <i>Faerie Queene</i>, is very different.
It is now the property of Lord Castletown.</p>

<p>One more fully appreciates the comfort of a
motor-car when forced suddenly as we were
last night to take a jaunting-car for a ride of
nine miles to Doneraile. That distance would
be nothing at all in the former vehicle, but is
every inch of nine miles in the latter. It's no easy
matter to hold one's seat in these cars. If you
happen to have a trotting horse it's not so difficult,
but if the beast is inclined to canter, as ours
was, the wheels of the car will almost leave the
ground with every canter, and chances are that
you will desert the car altogether. I came near
doing so several times last night, and reached
the court in a breathless state, which the horse,
with a wicked leer in his eye, seemed to enjoy to
the full. Tom, the driver, secure on his perch
in front, rode most of the way with his back to
the horse, which appeared to know whither
we were bound, Tom the while discoursing to me
upon the charms of hunting in Ireland and showing
me several of the favourite jumping places. I
did not enthuse; though I have ridden all my
life and hunted some, still a jump composed of a
stone wall, a hedge, and a deep drop on the far
side did not commend itself to me, especially
as a man had "broken his neck there but lately."
One can scarcely understand such clumsiness
on his part as the drop was quite sufficient for
horse and rider to turn a complete summersault,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
and still come out right side up. However, I
shall not try the trick, but that I would hesitate
for an instant, for such a reason, to join in the
national sport stamps me as unsportsmanlike&mdash;as
one who will not buy a horse, and that settles
my position, in Ireland.</p>

<p>We approached Doneraile Court through the
village of that name, which clusters close under
its park walls. Doneraile is quite <i>the</i> place in
this section, and we find it a stately mansion
presiding over one of the most beautifully wooded
parks in Great Britain.</p>

<p>These houses in Ireland, mostly all dating from
the Restoration, are commodious and ofttimes
stately structures, and have a beauty all their
own and very different from anything in England,
hence one cannot compare them. This estate
somewhat antedates that period as it was purchased
from Spenser's son by William St. Ledger,
President of Munster in Charles I.'s reign, and
the town gives the title to the family.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Doneraile presents a lofty and attractive front
to the park and the attraction abides as one
enters the spacious halls filled with the trophies
of the chase and with quaint arms gathered from
all over the world. In the distance a stately
staircase mounts to the upper floors and on the
left is a suite of handsome withdrawing-rooms
and a library, while the dining-room holds on its
walls many interesting family portraits, one of
which quite diverts my attention from the
conversation during dinner. It is that of Mrs.
Aldworth, and shows a very strong, determined
countenance. The finger on that book indicates
that you will believe what she tells you or she will
know the reason.</p>

<p>I have another picture of the lady from a painting
in Doneraile,&mdash;never photographed before,&mdash;but
it is not so distinct as the one I give, and is
merely that of a beautiful woman, a woman of the
world before her character has been developed.
Certainly none would dare claim&mdash;in her presence
at least&mdash;that the character of the lady in the
portrait I do give has not been developed, nor
would it be well to cast any aspersions upon that
character. You may think you know a thing
or two, but if wise you will not dare the owner
of that face yonder. Madam, I doubt not but
that you were the very best Mason the sun ever
shone upon, so let me alone, will you?</p>

<p>She was born in 1695, and her history is told
us by Lord Castletown in the room where its
great event occurred.</p>

<p>It is the first on your right in front as you enter
the mansion, and the interest of the house centres
there, for therein was being held in 1725 the
Free-masons' lodge when the Hon. Mary St.
Ledger, afterwards Mrs. Aldworth, hid herself,
some say in the great clock, and upon being discovered
was by those present condemned to
death, when one man so plead for her that her
life was spared and she was made a full-fledged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
Mason, the only one in the world's history. What
could follow an incident so romantic save a
wedding, and it did follow shortly. It is said
that she was condemned for ever to wear clocks
on her stockings, hence that name for that bit of
embroidery. It is also stated that Aldworth at
first voted for her death and she married him to
pay him out again. Whichever tale is correct it is
stated that in later years he more than regretted
that he had not voted for her death, but he was
probably a degenerate man, for the face in yonder
portrait was worth fighting for. In the room
where it all occurred are her masonic emblems,
a "square" about three inches long, the stone
above an amethyst, the rising sun above, gold,
and the rays diamonds (or old paste), a greyish
stone, and yellow amethyst in alternate rays.
A little thing to last when she who wore it and
created all this disturbance has been dust and
ashes since 1775.</p>

<p>The room is a double or alcoved apartment
with bookcases ranged around its walls, and
still holds, I believe, the same furniture as
upon the eventful night.</p>

<p>The talk drifted onward about her and many
other curious persons and things, and the smoke
from the cigars grew denser and denser until I
dreamed that I saw all sorts of vanished faces
in the space around me, and I fear that I was
dreaming actually when aroused by Major Beddoes
and told that "the ladies are retiring" and so we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
lighted their candles for them, and chatting a
moment at the foot of the staircase, watched them
disappear above.</p>

<p>Burne-Jones must have gotten the idea for his
famous picture from such a scene. There is no
place where a group of stately, beautifully gowned
women show to better advantage than upon a
staircase. I was strongly reminded of his painting
on this occasion. After all the custom of good
night to the ladies with the lighting of candles
and its pleasant chat is a pretty one though you
may object to their early disappearance and
would greatly prefer an hour's more talk with
them than with your own sex.</p>

<p>However, it is late to-night, and bidding our
host adieu we move off through the glades of the
park where Spenser wandered and dreamt so long
ago, pausing a moment by the lake where the
swans still drift as on a surface of molten silver.
The midsummer air is balmy and delightful and
a full moon lights up the woods until one almost
fancies the Faerie Queene is out in their glades
with all her court, or adrift on the lake with the
swans.</p>

<p>My stay in the barracks is drawing to a close,
and perhaps it is well. Major Beddoes threatens
me with arrest, fearing a riot if I am allowed to
wander around attending weddings and other
functions to which I have not been bidden.</p>

<p>During my sojourn I have employed a boy
named Tom who owns a sprightly horse and a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>
jaunting-car not more than a century old, the
latter harnessed to the former by means of strings.
We have had many a rare drive between the
hawthorn hedges, leaving the motor neglected in
a shed: its day will come.</p>

<p>I have been desirous since leaving Achill to
hear again that mournful cry for the dead,&mdash;"keening,"&mdash;and
had arranged with Tom to bring two
old women into the barracks after dark, to whom
I was to give half a crown each and a bottle of&mdash;let
us say "cologne"; but they did not materialise
and when I questioned Tom he replied, "Sure, sor,
I had 'em beyant Major Beddoe's rooms, but he
druv 'em away."</p>

<p>"Certainly I did," chimed in the Major; "do
you want me court-martialled?"</p>

<p class="pmb3">I would not object if it were in a good cause.
I think there is also a bit of personal malice
in his acts, as I laughed at him the other day.
He has lately married a charming wife, and is at
present quartered in Mallow, from whence he runs
the nine miles in a motor-car of his new father-in-law.
When he made his first appearance the
other day on the barracks compound, with all
the officers and their families assembled to greet
him, said motor-car looked as though it had been
through the wars, and was as pug-nosed as many
of the aborigines of the land, caused by sudden
contacts with stone gates and the sides of houses,
to say nothing of unexpected excursions through
old ladies' gardens and into gullies not intended
for motors. I laughed, I could not help it, hence
the malice aforesaid, with threats of arrest.</p>

<p>One day we are returning from a jaunt to
nowhere in particular, having been out just looking
for things to happen,&mdash;which they generally did,&mdash;when,
as we draw near the barracks, we pass a
dilapidated old trap with some men inspecting it.
One hails our boy with the query, "I say, Tom,
is that your family chariot?" Quick as thought
comes the reply: "Yes, and I am in want of a mule;
are <i>you</i> widout occupation?"</p>

<p>After that we find it advisable to order the car
into the barracks enclosure when dismissing it&mdash;at
which time I get a wink from Tom&mdash;we shortly
find ourselves ensconced before a bright fire in
the smoking-room.</p>

<p>The quarters are very comfortable. This room
is a large double apartment with easy chairs
and lounges, red rugs and carpets, two fire-places
for winter use, and books and cards galore. Downstairs
there is a billiard-room. The quarters of
the officers are cleanly and comfortable, the dwellers
therein a healthy, happy looking lot, though
they all agree with what I have said about the
bathrooms.</p>

<p>The regiment has collected its plate throughout
all the years since its foundation, nearly two centuries
and a half, and it forms a superb collection,
which I examined with great interest.</p>

<p>When in 1661 Charles II. married Catherine
of Braganza, Bombay was ceded to England by
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
Portugal as part of the dower of that princess.
This regiment of the Fusiliers was formed at that
time and has been in existence ever since. As the
years have gone by this plate, now amounting
in value to some thousands of pounds, has been
collected, and the designs and taste of two and a
half centuries are interestingly displayed in the
various articles, especially in the smaller pieces,
such as salt-cellars, snuff-boxes, etc. There are,
of course, the greater pieces, stately candelabra,
drinking-cups, and epergnes. One piece especially
attracted my attention, a train of silver cars, each
holding its crystal decanter for port, sherry,
brandy, etc., which after the cloth was removed
was rolled around the ancient table. This plate
and table go with the regiment at all times. It
even went to South Africa.</p>

<p>Captain D. got it all out for my inspection one
day and assured me that it was often in use even
in war times.</p>

<p>Therein lies the difference between the English
and Americans. They live and we spend our
lives getting ready to live, and rarely reach the
goal. A soldier especially realises that his life
is but from day to day, and therefore uses each
day, with all he owns, to the full. An American
regiment would store such plate and it would be
absolutely useless, rarely if ever seeing the light
of day,&mdash;but throughout its two centuries and
a half of existence this plate has had constant
usage and shows it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>Ah, well, what, I wonder, will be our manners
and customs when our nation, like this, has a
thousand years to its credit? What will America
be, what will England be then? Let us trust both
better and greater and grander than they are
now.</p>

<p>While I handle these dainty bits of silver that
have outlasted the lives of so many great men,
Captain D. pours bits of gossip about army life
and the late war into my ears, and I notice that
he does not hear very well on one side, and ask
why. "Oh, nothing much; a Boer bullet hit me
one day and clipped out a bit of my skull under
my left eye, coming out behind my ear, and destroying
my sight and hearing on that side,&mdash;it
was not much." No! I suppose all soldiers
would say it was merely in the line of their profession,
yet life is the best thing given to us, and
those who hold it at a nation's disposal should
have the best that nation can bestow at all times.
I have no doubt but that each nation intends to
give all&mdash;they are careless, not ungrateful.</p>

<p class="pmb3">After these days of rest in Buttevant barracks,
it is pleasant to see again our green car
glide round the corner and draw up at the door&mdash;not
that we have not used it while here. My
sojourn with these soldiers of the King has proven
a delightful experience which I shall never
forget. As we are loaded up and the car is
snorting to be off they crowd around us and we
make all sorts of appointments for future meetings,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
few of which in the usual course of life will ever
be carried out, but there is pleasure in the making.
With a last handshake, I give the word and the car
glides noiselessly forward, turns out through the
great archway, and Buttevant Barracks are a
thing of the past for us,&mdash;really so, as this regiment
moves in September to Fermoy.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>The route to Killarney lies through Mallow,
where it is amusing, at the little hotel,
to watch the airs and graces assumed by some
dozen Irish-Americans who have returned to their
native land for a visit after having made a dollar
or so in America. My Jap boy last night ventured
the remark that they "treat their own people
very nastily," which is quite true. One is
constantly impressed with the changed circumstances
of those returning to the old world. On
the inward-bound voyage last month I stood near
two of the ancient faith who were watching the
steerage below us. "Vell," said one, "that's the
vay I vent over." "Me, too," replied his
companion, and then complacently caressing
heavy gold watch chains stretched across capacious
stomachs, they strutted back to the smoking-room
and proceeded to abuse the steward for not
anticipating their wants. Such is life and progress,
I suppose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>But our car has left Mallow far behind and is
gliding onward by the side of the Blackwater,
whose course we follow for many miles.</p>

<p>This is a beautiful section of the land. There
are many fine estates on the hillsides and many
ruined and ivy-clad towers by the waters. We
have spent pleasant hours at several of the former
and rambled over many of the latter. In one
of the houses where we were for the "week end,"
I was amused by rather a singular custom. After
dinner, the men having settled to bridge in the
smoking-room I found myself, as I do not play
cards, in the hall with the ladies, of whom there
were several of the household and one visitor.
We were enjoying some music and dancing when
at nine o'clock in came our host and handing a
lighted candle to each dame literally shooed them
all off to bed, much to the indignation of the
visiting lady and my own astonishment. Paying
no attention to me, he returned to his game,
and I sat on in the dark hall so convulsed with
laughter that I was glad that the one candle left
shrouded my mirth by casting many shadows.
There were but two things for me to do, go and
watch the game, or go to bed, and I did the latter
though it was but nine o'clock. It is the custom
at all these country homes for the ladies to retire
long before the men, but I never before or since
have seen them so peremptorily driven off.</p>

<p>I think on the route to the Lakes that the
villages and straggling huts must be kept in
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
the state of squalor in which we found them to
the more thoroughly impress the newly arrived
tourists; certainly as we near Killarney they
are worse than any we have seen before,&mdash;rows
on rows of squalid, dirty houses through whose
open doors pigs or geese wandered, and beyond
which gleamed a bit of a fire; white-capped
or tozzle-headed women leaned chattering over the
low half doorway used to keep both children, pigs,
and geese from too freely passing off and away
between the high mud-banks with their towering
hedges of hawthorn. Droves of geese slip from
beneath our flying wheels and scoff at us as we
pass; chickens fly, screeching, to the safety of
neighbouring dung-heaps, and some ducks get a
gait on them that is most astonishing. It would
be impossible for them to maintain their balance
unless they kept up that furious pace.</p>

<p>As night closes in the clouds lower and finally
rain comes down heavily but fortunately not until
we have reached our journey's end, and the lights
from the quaint Hotel Victoria stream out a
welcome. They really act glad to see us and
from the proprietor down to "Dinnis" the buttons
each and all appear personally interested in our
arrival. How different from the magnificent
insolence of an American hotel clerk. But we
are too tired for further comparisons and are soon
off to bed.</p>

<p>To pass from the pomp and splendour of the
army and the kaleidoscopic, unrestful, rushing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
life of the world to the peaceful shores of Killarney
is a grateful change. It is so beautiful here to-day
and the world seems so far away that one has no
desire to do aught save sit under the waving
boughs of the trees and watch the glittering
waters of the lake. Off across its mirror-like
surface the mountains rise abruptly and over them
masses of white clouds hang broodingly, peacefully.
Lazily I wander over the grass, and entering
one of the many boats drifting in the water
allow the boy to row me away upon the glassy
surface.</p>

<p>Boyse is still in bed and so I have the boat to
myself and also all the lake, for there is no sound
or sign of life anywhere as we drift outward. The
boy moves the oars lazily, scarcely touching the
water with their tips, and we seem to drift halfway
between the white clouds overhead and those
far beneath us. Lily pads bearing their white
and gold chalices wave gently to and fro and a
stately white swan with her brood of little ones
keeps us company for a space.</p>

<p class="pmb3">I have not told the boy where to go and he has
not demanded to know, indeed he scarce seems
conscious of my presence, but keeps his dreamy
eyes fixed upon his beloved mountains brooding
yonder under fleecy clouds. Ahead of us a fairy
island floats waving green boughs in greeting
and as our boat grounds on its gravelly beach,
the boy rolls over and goes to sleep.</p>

<p>This is evidently the haven where we would be,
this holy Isle of Innisfallen, but it is some time
before I am willing to break the brooding silence
by any movement. The long drooping boughs of
the trees trail gently to and fro across the boat
and parting now and then give glimpses of the
chapel of St. Finian the leper, but it is so in ruins,
and it and its saint belongs so to the very
long ago, that to-day it is like a thought in a
dream.</p>

<p>As I wander off through the underwood shaded
by giant ash the spirits of the dead monks seem
all around me. The path leads to the grave of the
abbot, so long dead that a huge tree growing from
his ashes has encircled his tombstone with its
very roots. He lived&mdash;but let this poem tell his
story.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Augustine, Abbot of Innisfallen, stood<br /></span>

<p>It is said that Innisfallen may not be put to
profane uses, that early in the last century its
owner commanded that it be cultivated, but
when the work was begun the air at once became
filled with millions of white birds, whose beating
wings drove the men forth and away, leaving the
isle sacred and unprofaned, and the abbot and
his brethren to their dreamless slumbers, and so
the years glide by.</p>

<p>As I pause to-day by the abbot's grave, its
great tree rises above with arms extended, as
though in final benediction, the grasses are
spangled with millions of daisies, and the warm air
is again, as in his day, full of the song of birds, and
unless I desire a sleep of centuries it may be as
well to return to the world of to-day.</p>

<p>The boy in the boat awakes with a yawn, and
smilingly moves the boat off and away farther
and farther until the Holy Isle seems to detach
itself from the shimmering waters and to float
cloudlike slowly heavenward.</p>

<p>How little the casual tourist ever sees of any
land, especially of Ireland,&mdash;a day or two at
Killarney, an hour at Blarney, some time waiting
to hear Shandon bells, then a rush to Dublin and
the Causeway, and they leave the island with a
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>
shrug of the shoulders and a belief that there is
little to see. But wander into the byways, linger
in the lost corners and talk to these people,
and every moment will be of some sort of interest,&mdash;the
tears and sadness will pull your very
heartstrings one moment and laughter and fun
will bubble all around you in a mad frolic
an hour later. You may hear the wild songs
of the mountains, or the wilder wailing for
the dead, and the clouds will drift far overhead,
as though in mourning for their sorrows, then the
sunlight will follow after, sparkling, as though in
laughter. Some of the inns will be neat and comfortable,
whilst others will turn out like that
horror of a hotel in Galway.</p>

<p class="pmb3">We are welcomed on our return to that at
Killarney by "Dinnis." Now "Dinnis" is the
"buttons" of the house and stands up to the
magnificent altitude of four feet. He looks
about fifteen and when I ask him if he goes to
school I am about bowled over by his reply,&mdash;"I'm
a married man, sor." Great heavens! I am told
later that the fair bride is near twice Dinnis's
height and that his wooing was of such an ardent
nature that it nearly created a scandal. Ah,
well&mdash;we don't live but once and Dinnis believes
that if his life is to be as short as his stature, at
least it shall be a merry one. I am told also
that there are great expectations in his family
and as our car glides away I lean out and implore
him&mdash;if it's a boy&mdash;to name it "Mike." Dinnis's
indignation at my intrusion upon his private life
is vast but somewhat drowned out by a half-crown
and the roars of laughter from the car
boys around.</p>

<p>The poor car boys in Ireland, especially at
Killarney, are so many that there is not work for
all and they have to take certain days for each,
that all may have a share. The drivers of jaunting-cars
turn gloomy eyes at our auto as we roll by,
well knowing that the advent of such means loss
to them.</p>

<p class="pmb3">I was strongly tempted to essay the Gap of
Dunloe in the motor. The result would probably
have been a fight, as one of Cook's waggons was
attacked not long since while trying the same
thing. According to my recollection of that road,
its passage would not be at all difficult for a good
car, but once the legend of its impassability save
by ponies is done away with the occupation
of many hereabouts would be over for all time.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>I have never taken a more beautiful drive than
that from Killarney to Glengariff, and it is
especially delightful in a car, as one is spared a
slow and tedious ascent of the mountains. We
leave Killarney on a perfect morning; the motor
seems to have rested with our stay there, and
throbs with a healthy sound. The route takes us
through the domains of Kenmare and Muckross.
The latter has been sold by its ancient owners,
the Herberts, and now belongs to a prosperous
brewer of Dublin.</p>

<p>As we enter the domains we are stopped at the
gateway by a buxom dame, who demands a
shilling a head. I try to bargain with her,
offering half price for the Jap, and suggesting
that we may meet with a catastrophe which will
prevent our getting our money's worth. "It
makes no difference phat sort of quare heathen
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
you have wid yez, or if yez all died ten feet inside
the gate, yez will pay a shilling a head before
yez come a foot farther," and planting herself
directly before the car, she looked it squarely
in the eye&mdash;wherever that may be&mdash;and would
have kept her word. So I perforce hand over
four shillings, only to be detected in trying to pass
off an American quarter. As we roll inward
an anathema is hurled after us: "Ho, ho, ha, ha,
bad sess to the likes of yez."</p>

<p>How beautiful it is here&mdash;how delicious the
day! The sun shines hot and the air is laden
with the odour of the balsam. The superb roadway
winds in and out for miles, now by the lake
and here in the deep green of the forest, with
enchanting views of the mountains. Bird-like
the car skims over ancient stone bridges, or close
to the water, and we pause a moment to do homage
at the shrine of Muckross, and finally cross the
old weir bridge, declining the bog-oak work for
sale by the old man who tried to sell us such
thirty years ago,&mdash;same man and same work, I
think.</p>

<p>From here on the road mounts higher and
higher, twisting and turning until I am not sure
in which direction we are really going, and am
reminded of a remark of a dear aunt of mine,
while riding on a narrow-gauge railroad near
Denver, "Really, I very many times saw the
back of my own bonnet."</p>

<p>Here, to-day, while far different from the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
rugged grandeur of our western mountains, the
vistas are equally charming. There, it is not so
much, to my thinking, in the splendour of the
hills as in the prospect over the limitless plains.
Vast and grandly mysterious, they roll up to the
very point where the mountains rise abruptly
from their western limits, and as one gazes outward
they resemble the ocean itself suddenly calmed
into eternal sleep by the mandate of God, "Peace,
be <i>still</i>," and those western plains are indeed
<i>still</i>.</p>

<p>This prospect in the old world shows the traveller
the entire panorama of Ireland's most beautiful
mountains, and far below him nestle the chain of
Killarney's enchanted lakes, where the fairies
dance nightly and the daisies bloom for ever. But
why attempt description? All the world knows
Killarney, and to-day I seem to hear her wild
echoes as they bear away the love song of Dermot
Asthore.</p>

<p>The road from here descends in sweeping curves
seaward and our car scarcely seems to touch the
ground, as with all power off and the wings out it
sails downward, until we come to rest at Glengariff,
just as the setting sun tinges her rocks
and waters with rose colour.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The Atlantic is at rest far out and sends only
whispers inward on the ripples to-night. The
surface of the bay is dotted with many white
swans floating majestically shoreward. I believe
they are native here. At least we are told that
these have their nests on the farther rocks and
rear their young in freedom; even in winter the
weather is mild enough to allow of their being
out of doors.</p>

<p>Are these the children of Lir still under enchantment
in the shape of swans? One hears of them
at Ballycastle, and on the island of Achill, but
this is the only place where they have appeared
and yonder old gentleman swan has an eye which
would indicate knowledge of much that he has
no intention of telling us about.</p>

<p>One does not see the outer ocean at all at
Glengariff. The whole prospect is that of an
enclosed lake, where one might drift for ever without
danger from the tempests which howl around
this coast at times.</p>

<p>Not until we reach Bantry Bay does the outer
ocean show itself. After all, what is there in a
name? That of Bantry Bay had always attracted
me, and I had expected to find such a spot as
Glengariff, but it is far from that in all ways, being
tame and unattractive, though evidently a much
better harbour for shipping.</p>

<p>Here our route leaves the coast and turning
inland passes beneath the shadow of the Boggeragh
Mountains, where there are so many ancient
towers and castles that to visit or relate the tales
of each would be to rewrite the folklore of
Ireland.</p>

<p>One of them, however, cannot be passed in
silence, or the spirits which inhabit it might
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
execute dire vengeance for the slight. The gloomy
castle of the MacCarthys of Duishane, Carrig-a-pooka,
rears its dark towers on a steep rock close
to our route, and it is the reputed abode of that
spirit of evil, the Pooka, which in all malice and
mischief has no equal in the fairy lore of Ireland.
He has many forms which he may assume at will,&mdash;sometimes
a bull, sometimes an eagle, but more
often a horse spouting fire, as he tears through
the darkness. He does not show his demon qualities
until he has secured a rider, but on gloomy
nights is met with in the shape of a docile nag,
browsing on the highway and almost inviting
you to mount and ride,&mdash;but do so and at once
he changes into the wildest and most terrible
charger man ever mounted and fairly flies over
castle, lake, and river, into deep valleys and over
the highest mountains and even far out over the
ocean. What becomes of the rider is not told
for he does not return, though 'tis said that one
Jerry Deasy did get the best of a Pooka and by
the means of spur and whip reduced even this
"divil" into a quiet trot.</p>

<p>Downward from the mountains our road winds
once more through the fair green country in the
valley of the Sullane. We pause a moment before
Macroom Castle, the ancient fortress of the
O'Flynns, not because of its beauty, which from
its mantle of ivy is great, but because it was the
birthplace of the father of William Penn, who
gave peace to all with whom he came in contact
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
in life and undoubtedly has found peace in
Heaven.</p>

<p>The old castle has seen more of war and its
horrors than should fall to the lot of any one spot.
It has been destroyed by fire several times, and
at one execution nine outlaws were hanged within
its court for murder. It is not a place which the
superstitious seek, after dark or when winds
wake and the chains clank. From Macroom
onward the route lies through a smiling valley
until finally the silver toned bells of Shandon
welcome us to the city of Cork.</p>

<p>The Imperial Hotel in Cork is crowded with
people and dirt. I think the latter will prevail,
as it is of the mouldy order. The floors seem sinking,
and en route to the dining-room one walks
as upon the deck of a rolling ship with danger
of sharp collision against passing waiters. True
Irish gentlemen, who look not upon the wine when
it is red but drink straight old Irish whiskey in
unlimited quantities, are encountered with the
result that between the floors and themselves
one has difficulty in navigating and takes to
port several times en route to dinner.</p>

<p>This is the week of a cattle and horse show&mdash;the
viceroy is here and incidentally most of the rest of
Ireland, not that the viceroy's presence has anything
to do with their coming, they give you to
distinctly understand <i>that</i>, but that wherever a
horse is to be shown, there come the sons of Erin.
I think there is something in the profession or
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>
tastes of a man which stamps his face and figure.
One could never mistake any man here for other
than horsey,&mdash;all clean, yet the air is fragrant
with the smell of the stalls and aroma of much
good whiskey. Where they stow away all the
latter is a puzzle to me, for their bodies most
certainly cannot carry such amounts of ballast as
I have seen poured into them all day long. Not
to be horsey completely ostracises a man, but
as that gives one an opportunity to escape the
drinks and so watch the crowd, it is not to me
objectionable.</p>

<p>While Cork is "a place of advanced ideas"
and probably less favourable to the powers that
be than any other section of Ireland, still she
does not approve of change in the city or its manners
or customs. This hotel has not had a thing
done to it in more than a quarter of a century.
I believe it makes money all the time, hence improvements
are not necessary, certainly they are
not made, as witness those floors. One is still
beset by the importunate boys with their "cars"
at its doors and all over the town, but the driver
of a jaunting-car is a jolly beggar full of laughter
and fun and thereby puts many an extra shilling
into his pocket.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Rags and tatters many of them, that is as to
themselves, but this does not extend to their
horses,&mdash;he is indeed a poor Irishman and not
of pure blood who neglects his horse, and with him
it is love me, love my nag. He will meet your
smile with one brighter, and kindness to him
<i>does</i> "butter the parsnips" of the traveller.</p>

<p>Leaving the hotel the other day Boyse summoned
a car, but the driver thereof was in such
a state of tatters that the lady of the party
refused to ride in that car. To the driver of the
one chosen she remarked, "That man must be
very poor; you should club together and buy him
new clothes." "Poor,&mdash;not at all, me lady; he's
rich, but so ticklesome that not a tailor in town
can take his measure."</p>

<p>As we are en route to the fair grounds I
discover that Boyse does not approve of my
costume, but it is some time before I find out
wherein I fall short. It turns out to lie in my
hat, a <i>brown</i> Derby. At home black hats vanish
with warm weather and brown take their place,
but here I learn that a brown Derby belongs to
the "fast lot which one does not know,"&mdash;<i>hence</i>
Boyse's disgust, but that does not affect me in the
least and I insist upon wearing my brown hat.
I really think it almost spoiled his pleasure in the
horse show, if anything could do that.</p>

<p>The day turns out pleasant and the crowd is
large. The viceroy does not come, which certainly
detracts not at all from the pleasure of the people,
as the real viceroy, the horse, is here in full state.
Several of the officers are down from Buttevant
and we pass a merry afternoon clouded only by
Boyse's feeling about my hat&mdash;he sits afar off and
does not appear to know me when acquaintances
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
pass or if an introduction occurs is careful to
state that I am an American&mdash;what a multitude
of sins that covers;&mdash;I trust the statement is
altogether unnecessary and that I could never
be taken for anything else.</p>

<p>We are held a day at Cork for repairs to the
car, but, those finished, roll rapidly away in the
direction of Fermoy. These roads are very good
and the motor glides smoothly and rapidly onward,
first by the banks of the Lee and then northeastward
towards Fermoy. The day is misty and
damp, forcing the hood over our heads, though I
would almost rather get wet than have it up.
However, one must consider fur robes, etc., so
up it goes.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter I note a clicking sound
underneath and an unsatisfactory movement
of the motor, which causes the chauffeur to slow
down and stop. A lengthy examination mends
matters for a time, but the trouble occurs again and
then Robert announces that we must return to
Cork as the water won't circulate. We are twelve
miles out with no place en route for help. We are
also about the same distance from Fermoy but in
that direction and but three miles away there is a
town where cars may be had and help obtained,
so onward we move, and wisely, as matters turn
out, for we come to a final halt on the confines of
the village. Loading the luggage and ourselves
upon two cars we drive to Fermoy leaving orders
to have the motor towed in by a mule, ignoble
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
as that may sound. As it turns out even the
motor rebels at such disgrace and refuses to
move even by the use of two mules. Robert
manages, however, to get it over the eight miles
to Fermoy by its own power, in some four hours,
allowing much oil to run into the water tubes,&mdash;not
the best thing for the motor but all that
could be done. I can see that he is decidedly
disgruntled with the car. This is the third time
it has been in the shop in two weeks, which
certainly should not have been the case with a
new car such as I was assured this was. When
I state this to the chauffeur, he laughs and
replies, "<i>New!</i> Yes, as to the body, but the
motor is some years old, in fact is the original
Panhard motor used by Mr. Harvey du Gros; it
has been lengthened and repaired and a new body
put upon it."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> Fortunately we have each time
been where help was at hand save on this occasion.
But as it turns out Robert can repair it in this
hotel yard as they have a pit to work in. He
had thought that the trouble arose from oil and
waste getting into and clogging the water pipes,
but it proves to have been a broken pin in the
wheel of the pump,&mdash;"broken through age," he
states. If this accident had occurred in the wilds
of Mayo or Sligo far from any assistance our plight
would have been a serious one, and I cannot but
feel that to send the car out as new, knowing the
motor, the only important part, to be old was
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
scarcely fair,&mdash;in fact, far from it. Robert is an
excellent chauffeur and thoroughly understands
and is able to repair a machine. In this last
case, however, we had to buy a new wheel.</p>

<p>The town is a small garrison town and we are
delayed there only one night. Still I must acknowledge,
as has been so often the case, that
its little hotel was far more comfortable than
those in most of the large towns and cities of Ireland.
Its rooms are cleanly and the food good.</p>

<p>The roads from Fermoy to Clonmel, the depot of
the "Royal Irish," B.'s old regiment, are hilly
but good, and the auto takes on life once more,
though I notice that Robert seems concerned
as to the result. However the machinery warms
to its work after an hour and we speed onward,
breathing more freely as the pulsations settle
down into a rhythmical beat, finally rolling into
the barracks at Clonmel in good season. There
we spend a pleasant hour, lunching with the officers
of the mess and having no time for the town
itself, which is not of interest.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The roads are fine all of the afternoon, most
of them well rolled. Our route is eastward
through the valley of the Blackwater, evidently
a stream of importance in ancient days, as its
course is guarded by towers and castles, now all
in ruins and given over to clambering ivy. At
Waterford the stream is broad and deep and
ocean steamships lie moored at her quays.</p>

<p>The afternoon sun shines brilliantly as we
cross the river Suir and enter Waterford, one
of the most ancient towns of the kingdom, yet one
which well survives the passing centuries, holding
still the bustle and clangour of life in its streets and
on its quays, which stretch for a mile and more
along the banks of the river and where you will
find a good steamship which in eight hours will
land you in New Milford,&mdash;but we are not to leave

cover much of that of Ireland, which is not
necessary here. Suffice it to say that this south-east
end of the island appears to have been the
first to attract outside barbarians and we find
records of the Danes here back in 853. Reginald
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
reigned here in the eleventh century, and I find
myself blinking up at his round tower which still
keeps watch and ward over this river.</p>

<p>There are others in the town if one cares to look
for them, but like this of Reginald all have fallen
from their high estate. This is but a police
station now. Of King John's palace nothing
remains. In fact relics of the past are not many
in Waterford.</p>

<p>We pause a moment at the Franciscan Friary,
which Sir Hugh Purcell built in 1220. It is in
ruins, of course, and is quite in the heart of the
city, unnoticed save by some wandering spirit.
Grass grows thickly under its arches and there are
many flat tombstones bearing historic names
and those of families well-known to-day.</p>

<p>Not far away stands the cathedral, too entirely
renovated, in fact rebuilt, to be of interest, save
for some curious monuments. One especially,
that of a man named Rice, represents his body
as they found it a year after death,&mdash;a toad sits
on his breast, and we turn away with anything
but pleasant thoughts. It seems he commanded
that his tomb be opened after a year and
his monument made, holding a copy in stone of
his body exactly as they should find it,&mdash;hence
this repulsive statue. There are but few who
would care to attain earthly immortality in that
manner.</p>

<p>Every road in Wexford will lead one to or near
some relic of the past. Seven miles out from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
Waterford we find Dunbrody Abbey, standing
serene and stately in the midst of a great meadow
and near to an arm of the sea. Dunbrody is
called the most beautiful ruin in the county and
it has been a ruin for nearly four hundred years,
having been suppressed by Henry the Eighth. Its
abbots and monks have long since gone the way
of all flesh and one must now cultivate the good
graces of a little old woman in a neighbouring
house if one would enter the sacred precincts, for
though ancient, if one door in its outer walls be
locked, even an enterprising man of the twentieth
century may not enter its courts. We tried it and
the great central tower seemed to smile down upon
us in derision. All the while the little old lady
stood afar off, holding the key, which we did not
get until we had paid for it.</p>

<p>The world does not come to Dunbrody very
often. The tourist world knows nothing of it&mdash;in
fact, all this most interesting section of Ireland
is as yet unexplored by the tide of travel rushing
northward from Queenstown. Certainly to-day
nothing comes near us and we spend a delightful
hour in the warm sunshine high up on the great
tower, and then awakening Robert, who in turn
starts the motor to life, we roll off through the
shady lanes once more.</p>

<p>The day's work is over and these simple people
are resting from their labours. We have just passed
one comfortable old dame seated on a chair under
the bending boughs of the hawthorn. She wore
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
a great frilled white cap and knitted industriously,
while in her lap a white kitten lay asleep. She
greeted us with a pleasant smile as we rolled into
and out of her life and away toward Bannow
House, the home of the Boyse family. I had
visited Bannow last year; when leaving the train
at New Ross I had expected to find its entrance
gateway not more than a mile or two away, and
fell back aghast when the boy who met me with
the dog-cart quietly remarked that it was a drive
of eighteen miles. I must confess that that is
farther than I care to live from the railway, and
Boyse has acknowledged that that distance home
has several times deterred his departure from London&mdash;not
but what that might have been a mere
excuse for London is just London and means much.
However, a new railroad is now opened only
three miles from Bannow, and to-day our car
annihilates the eighteen miles in short order.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Crossing the river at New Ross the road leads
towards the sea. There is a fine highway all the
distance, winding but well made, and the car
appreciates that fact, and makes fair time until
we turn into the gates of the home park and
roll onward through its avenues of rhododendrons
to the entrance. Then the car vanishes around
to its quarters for a few days.</p>

<p>I know of no more attractive, peaceful spot
than Bannow House. It is a large square stone
mansion with some centuries to its credit and
stands in the meadow-lands close to the sea in
the south-east corner of the county of Wexford
and in a park of some eight hundred acres. One
hears the murmur of the ocean but the house is
secluded by avenues of trees which cut off the
view of the sea and also shelter the place from
the fury of the winds.</p>

<p>Coming into the possession of the Boyse family
with the restoration of Charles II., it has grown
until to-day, with its spreading wings, it is an
extensive establishment, a typical Irish home.
You find many such about the land, all charming
places to live in. Springing into existence as the
use and need for castles passed away, they are
built of stone and in the case of Bannow House
the stone portico has its monolith columns,&mdash;what
they call here "famine work." In the dreary
winter of 1847 the people worked out their debt to
the landlord, for food, etc., in this manner. The
fine avenue of trees through which we approached
the house is also the result of "famine work."</p>

<p>Entering the house, one finds a large square
hall ornamented with spears and shields from
Africa and objects from all over the world, gathered
throughout the years up to date by its former
masters and its present owner.</p>

<p>To one's right is a spacious dining-room, to the
left a ball-room, while behind the hall is another
square hall holding a stair which ascends on two
sides into a gallery above. At the left of this, one
enters on the main floor a spacious drawing-room,
where I have spent many a pleasant evening.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span></p>

<p>Bannow is full of the portraits of those who
have lived and died here. They face me at the
table, peer at me on the staircase from unexpected
nooks and corners, and beam down upon
me in the mellow lamplight of the drawing-room,
each one with a tale of its own, I fancy, and one
can trace the passing centuries by the different
styles of dress. Yonder damsel with that long
neck should have lived in the days of beheading
at the block as she would have been a splendid
subject; that quaint old gentleman in the corner
knew a thing or two and could tell a good story,
I doubt not. Yonder lady with the towering
wig was a beauty in her day, but, deserted by her
husband, who fled to America, she was taken under
the patronage of Queen Charlotte. I spend many
a moment talking to these old pictures and I think
they answer always.</p>

<p>The bedrooms at Bannow range themselves
around the gallery,&mdash;mine is off at the end of a
long passageway and is haunted, so the story
runs, by a "grey lady." Wheels are heard
driving furiously now and then up the avenue
at midnight and pausing at a walled-up door,
then the grey lady flits around the gallery and
into this room, where some time since in a hidden
niche in the wall an ancient rosary was discovered.
The dame of the shadows does not appear to be
a malign spirit, certainly she has not disturbed
me as I have slept very soundly in her old chamber.</p>

<p>To-night as I lean out the window, the moon
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
is at the full, flooding the terrace below, and its
stone stairs, guarded by vases and stone pine cones
yonder, gleam whitely as they mount under the
shadows of an old yew tree. The fragrance of
sweet grasses fills the air and the night is full of
silence save for the brooding calls of some doves
in the forest, and I wait and watch for the grey
lady but she does not come.</p>

<p>Do you know the legend of the wood pigeon?
If not, then the next time you hear one, listen
and it will almost tell it without further words
from me. Once a man went to steal a cow in the
days when cattle-lifting was the proper thing and,
when deep in the forest, declared that the wood
pigeons, or doves, as we call them, insisted that
he should "take two&mdash;coos&mdash;Paddy," "take two&mdash;coos&mdash;Paddy,"
and so he did, and still these
birds of the forest will say to you if you listen,
"take two&mdash;coos&mdash;Paddy," and for ever after
you will hear the same as you listen to their voices.</p>

<p>Just now there is one on the yew tree by the terrace
steps strongly insisting upon a double depredation
on my part of the adjoining pasture, and
his plaint grows louder and more insistent as I
close the window, leaving him to exercise his corrupting
influence upon those who may pass in the
night.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Wandering the next morning up the stone
steps and nearly in the forest I find an ancient
garden of great extent enclosed by a lofty wall.
I have already seen such at Doneraile Court and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
I know that they are charming spots,&mdash;something
we can never have in America as we have no
time for them, our places change hands so constantly.
I enter this one at Bannow House
through a trellis of white roses embowering a door
in the wall and am confronted by a tree fuchsia
towering above me and casting its crimson and
purple blossoms down on my cap. The enclosure
is five acres in size, surrounded by a wall of brick
some thirty feet high. Golden and crimson
and white roses nod at me from the walls or
peer over the top at the deep, cool woods without.
Formal beds bordered in privet line the
straight walks. Glories of white lilies, purple
lilies, scarlet poppies, and nasturtiums throw
splotches of colour all around. In the centre
stands an old stone sun-dial and passing through
an archway, gnarled, squat apple trees and gooseberry
bushes are found lining the paths, while
to the walls cling plum and pear trees. Flaming
hollyhocks light up shadowy corners, and from a
distant tool-house an old cat is sedately leading a
lot of kittens anything but stately and a great
care to their mother. From under a currant
bush wanders an old duck, a sad looking dame,
acquainted with grief, I doubt not. She recalls
to mind when as a child sitting at the feet of my
mother I watched the approach of a similar old
duck who gravely waddled up and laid close
to the hand which had been good to her a fragment
of a shell, striking a note of tragedy thereby.
We had often fed her on her nest by the brook
and now she brought this as a token that some
vandal had destroyed her home, and so we found it.
As I am thinking of her in this garden far enough
off from that brook a stray cat wanders out from
a hot-house and sits down to regard me, bottle
flies buzz in the sunlight, and I wonder whether
there is an outside world of rushing unrest.</p>

<p>This morning the pony cart is in requisition
and, with one of the ladies, I am off for a visit to
the buried city of Bannow. It is sometimes
pleasant to banish the auto and jaunt slowly
along. The pony understands that to-day we
have all the time there is and so takes it leisurely
with every now and then a grab at the hawthorn
blossoms which bend temptingly toward him in
the narrow lanes. He seems to know the way
and finally wanders close down by the sea to where
at the end of a long grassy lane we are halted by a
high-barred gate through which some cattle
gaze wonderingly outward. Wending our way
through the tall grasses we mount to where
Bannow church holds its ruined watch over the
dead within and around it and over the city
buried in the sands and under the sea. Aside
from the sanctuary there is no evidence that man
ever lived here, yet back in the days of James I.
Bannow was a prosperous town paying the crown
rents on two hundred and more houses, but a great
storm arose in that same reign and so filled up
the entrance to its harbour as to destroy it, and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
from that period onward the sentence of death
was carried out against the ancient city. Higher
and higher rose the sands until they covered all
except this ruined church and the dead which
lie around it, but,&mdash;here comes in a strange law
or custom,&mdash;though there was absolutely nothing
to represent, the place for generations returned
two members to Parliament, and for the loss of
this privilege the Earl of Ely received fifteen
thousand pounds sterling. Certainly those two
members were not annoyed by the wishes or
opinions of their constituents deep in their graves
here.</p>

<p>As I move through the long grasses to enter
the ruins I pause a moment to pay tribute at the
tomb of one Walter French, a man who passed
one hundred and forty years upon the earth and
"died in the prime of life." His last illness
was the result of his walking some miles carrying
a piece of iron weighing over one hundred weight,
and which "somewhat strained the muscles
around his heart, and he sickened and died,
much to the astonishment of all who knew him."
He has been dead but a short time and there are
many now here who remember him well. Peace
to his ashes, and here on this breezy down beneath
the shadow of this ancient church and with yonder
murmuring sea close by it should be peaceful
enough even for the dead. The church is one of
the oldest in Ireland and long antedates the English
invasion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not extensive, but it is quaint and interesting
and possesses some curious monuments and one
pretentious stone sarcophagus. Who slept there,
I wonder?&mdash;there is no trace of him now. Bishop
or layman, he has vanished, leaving no sign or
name; and when he does come again will he
pass by here? How strange Bannow church
will appear to him then&mdash;and where will he
search for the mortal part of him? It is certainly
not here in this tomb which he vainly imagined
would hold his body inviolate throughout all time
and to the portals of eternity.</p>

<p>This is a Sunday afternoon of midsummer, a
warm balmy day when the waters have gone
to sleep and the bees hum drowsily. Over the
hills and through the lanes come groups of
peasantry, in their Sunday best. The usual
number of dogs appear and chase imaginary rabbits
through the long grasses, and on yonder flat
tombstone a lad and lassie are gaily dancing a
jig, and I doubt if the mortal or spiritual part
of the sleeper beneath them is at all disturbed
by the apparent desecration of his resting-place.</p>

<p>Save on Sunday the living rarely come here
but to leave one of their number who has passed
the far horizon of life, or sometimes to dance
by day as we see them, or in the moonlight,
on the great flat tombstones of the Boyse family
in the chancel, listening while they rest to the
constant advice of the wood doves to "take two
coos, Paddy."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>We are favoured with the same admonition,
but though those fine red cows are tempting we
pass onward, to the increasing indignation of the
inhabitants of yonder trees.</p>

<p>As we turn for a last look at Bannow church
on its green hill, the roofless gables are sharply
silhouetted against the glow of evening, and the
lad and lassie are still gaily dancing their jig, and
two others on a neighbouring slab are "sittin'
familiar."</p>

<p>So leaving them we wander back, to find the
pony, after having her fill of daisies and grasses,
has lain down in the shafts and gone to sleep.
When we reach home there is still much of the
evening left, and, deserting the pony&mdash;for which
it casts reproachful glances upon us&mdash;we enter
the motor and roll away again.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is not however an hour for hurry or speed
and our car glides slowly along while we enjoy
the delicious air.</p>

<p>As we pass by the door of an humble cabin, the
turf fire within illuminates the interior, throwing
the bright scarlet dress of a girl into bold relief
against a dark wall, and lighting up the bent figure
of an old man smoking on a bench by the fireplace.
In one corner is a bed while in another a huge
pig lies asleep. The dark eyes of the girl meet
mine for an instant with a pathetic hopeless
expression but the old man pays no sort of
attention, and we roll away, only to come suddenly
just around a corner on a donkey drawing
a cart, upon which is perched a buxom old lady.
The beast objects most decidedly to our appearance,
and after an instant of inaction, during
which he stares in afright with his ears pointed
forward, he begins to back, and the old woman to
screech, more in indignation than fear, it strikes
me, but be that as it may, both keep in action
until brought to a standstill under the bending
boughs of a gigantic fuchsia, whose purple blossoms
are cast downward, and all over the vast white
frilled cap of the old lady. Except in plastering
the dame against that beautiful tree, no harm
was done, and I throw her a kiss as we roll away,
while faintly on the air is borne to my ears the
anathema, "Ye spalpeen, yez." There is more,
but our wings are out by now and it is lost in the
distance. However I would not hesitate to
apply to that old lady were I in trouble and I
know I would not apply in vain, though she might
read me a lecture the while and even bestow a
clout with her big soft hand which would be more
in the nature of a caress than a censure.</p>

<p>How time and people have changed in America
during the past forty years! Then our land
was sprinkled with settlements by these Irish,
where one could find all the quaint manners and
customs of their homeland; wakes were as strictly
carried out there as here, weddings were just the
same, and around each humble home clustered
a bit of atmosphere of the old world.</p>

<p>Who does not remember the "tin man," generally
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span>
named John, who made his rounds with a
tin-shop of no mean proportions crowding his red
waggon? Then there were the tinkers, but I
must state that they were of a better order than
those of Wexford to-day. We have just passed
a dirty cart and forlorn pony, driven by a man
more dirty and wretched-looking, if that be
possible. I am told he is the head of the tinkers
of Wexford, and that a more disreputable lot
of tramps does not exist on this earth. As for
morality, they have never heard of such a word,
and certainly do not know its meaning. In their
slovenly villages, they live in the most promiscuous
manner and when the men start on their summer's
tramp each takes along some woman who pleases
him, regardless of what the degree of consanguinity
may be. One must see them on their native heath
to comprehend fully the force and meaning of the
expression, "I don't care a tinker's dam"&mdash;but
our motor has stopped before a great iron gate
beyond which stretch the glades of a magnificent
park. On entering I notice a sign on one of the
great trees, "Wards in Chancery," and wonder
"what have we here."</p>

<p>I doubt not that many of my readers have
visited the great estates of Europe, but unless
they have seen Tintern Abbey in Wexford&mdash;the
quaintest of all abodes in this quaint Ireland&mdash;they
have still an experience before them.</p>

<p>The history of Tintern dates back to 1200,
when the Earl of Pembroke&mdash;he who married
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span>
the Lady Isabel de Clare, Strongbow's daughter&mdash;founded
this abbey to the Virgin after being
delivered from the sea on the coast near-by. It
was named after and peopled by monks from
Tintern in Wales, which was founded by the
De Clares, and while the cathedral could not
have been so extensive as the one there, the
entire monastery was quite as large as the older
establishment. It must have been a glorious
place and is so even now in its ruins, and is one
of the most interesting spots in the island. It
lifts its towers amidst groves of stately trees in a
valley but a short distance from the sea and is
embowered in clambering ivy. Its great tower,
still preserved as a ruin, is not habitable save in its
lower story, which is used as a kitchen. The
chancel of the abbey has been turned into a
dwelling-place and one of the most curious I have
ever inspected. It is late on a brilliant afternoon
when our car, rolling down the broad avenue of
the park, comes suddenly upon the ancient structure
in its secluded valley. At first all appears to
be in ruins until we note that some of the arches
have been walled up and hold modern windows.
There are bits of ruin everywhere,&mdash;moss-grown
stairs with shattered heads on the rail lead to
shadowy terraces over which ancient yew trees
extend sheltering arms; ruined arches and ivied
towers dot the meadow, and vine-draped pillars
standing far apart show the once great extent of
the abbey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Rolling on we round the corner of the main
structure and draw up in the great courtyard,
which evidently, in the days of the abbey's
grandeur, was the cloister. To our pulling an
ancient bell makes loud reply off in the tower
above us, but for some moments no sign of life
is evidenced. Finally the door is opened by a
servant who reminds one of Obaldistone in Scott's
<i>Bride of Lammermoor</i>. His manner is as grand
as though this were the portals of Windsor Castle.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Yes, Mrs. C&mdash;&mdash; is at home, and will be glad
to see us. We are ushered into one of those
quaintly interesting rooms to be found only in the
old world, a room impressed by each passing
owner with some of his or her own personality,
individuality, without which no room has any
charm. Yonder is a portrait by Sir Peter Lely
of a lady evidently lovesick. Here is a bit of
some framed fancy work whose faded colours
plainly show that it was done by a hand long
since still for ever. Ivy peers into the window
and taps on the glass and there is a taint of the
buried years in the air,&mdash;the very sunlight seems
to belong to late October.</p>

<p>Bestowed by Elizabeth upon the ancestor of its
present owner, Tintern has suffered the fate of most
great Irish houses and now lives in the memory of
the past. I am shown a parchment holding the
family tree, dating backward to 1299, with all
its numberless coats of arms done in colour, but
evil times came down upon the race in the last
century. Open house was kept for all who passed.
Beggars sat by the scores in its great courtyard
sure of their dole. In its entrance hall stood a
bowl of small silver coins for general usage, and
it was dipped into by all. Its sideboards groaned
with a feast on all days,&mdash;waste and plenty,
plenty and waste,&mdash;until finally upon the death
of one owner a question arose as to the succession
and so in came the law and the Court of Chancery.
That suit cost the estate one hundred thousand
pounds sterling, and was finally settled by a
workman who discovered the necessary missing
documents in a hidden receptacle in the wall,
but too late to save trouble, and so to-day and
each day Tintern is going more and more into ruin,
and the voracious ivy climbs ever higher and
higher, pointing like the handwriting on the
wall to the ending of it all.</p>

<p>In the midst of all these reflections our hostess
enters, a typical Irish lady, all hospitality and
warm welcome, as cordial to me whom she has
never seen before, as to her old friends who have
brought me thither. Her hearty laugh drives off
the shadows and she is much pleased that we are
interested in her old home: old,&mdash;yes verily&mdash;just
think of it, her people have lived right here
for three hundred years, and but for the secretion
of those documents by some stupid ancestor the
domain would be a rich one even yet. But that
does not keep laughter out of Tintern. Many's
the dance which has been given here, and once,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>
with that love of humour which laughs at everything
sad or mournful, the cards of invitation bore
the phrase, "Supper in the charnel house and
dancing in the vaults." Rest assured the feast
was lively, leaving nothing for any ghosts which
might happen along that night, and I doubt their
braving the laughter of that merry throng; and
yet with it all there must have been sadness for
all which had been so uselessly lost.</p>

<p>There are many legends for the cause of the
troubles which have come upon the abbey and
its owners.</p>

<p>For holding property belonging to the Church
they are for ever under its curse of fire and water;
then the neighbouring peasantry have a legend
that trouble arose because of the murder by Sir
Anthony of all the friars he found in the house when
he came to take possession, but they rather incline
to the belief that he rested under a curse of the
fairies because he destroyed an ancient rath, or
hill, which they frequented. He was engaged to
the lovely heiress of Redmond. Having gone to
England, his lady promised to burn a light in her
tower of Hook to guide him on his return, and
so she did, but the fairies beguiled her to slumber
with their music, and put out the light. So her
lover was drowned. The disconsolate maiden
converted her father's tower into a lighthouse,
and so it remains to this day.</p>

<p>It is also stated that the first Colclough was
but secretary to the lord who obtained the grant
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
and was sent by him to England to have it ratified.
He so pleased the Virgin Queen that when he
returned he found that the deeds conferred the
estates upon himself.</p>

<p>I noticed in the drawing-room a framed address
or diploma of some sort and asked what it was.
It contained the portrait of a handsome man
in the prime of life and the emblazonments were
many and rich. During the life of the late owner
he was master of the hounds, and it was decided
to present him with this illuminated address
together with a present of one hundred pounds.
The event was made the occasion of a great feast,
and these old walls rang so loudly with the merriment
that the rooks in the ruined tower were
startled, and fled shrieking into the forests. The
presentation was made with much ceremony, the
illuminated parchment greatly admired, also
the casket which held the purse with its hundred
pounds, but which of course was not opened until
the guests had all gone or been carried home.
No gentleman would leave such a feast able to
walk,&mdash;and the flunkies outside knew their duty
and did it. Now it seems the recipient of all
this owed ninety-eight pounds to the man who
had made the presentation speech, and when
all had gone and the family had gathered round to
examine the purse they found upon opening it
two pounds in money and a receipted bill for those
ninety-eight pounds. Ah well, 'twas all in a lifetime
and life went merrily in those days at
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
Tintern. But it was a shabby trick, for the
neighbours each and all owed very much more in
hospitality to Tintern than the amount of that bill.</p>

<p>While I am inspecting the framed address the
bell of the castle clangs, the butler throws open
the doors, and we pass to the dining-room for tea,
the most pleasant meal of the day over here.</p>

<p>When the grandfather of our hostess died, he
was laid out, as befitted the head of the house, on
this dining table around which we are gathered.
I know that the thought of it returns to several
of us as we sit here.</p>

<p>There is a vast thickness in the walls of the
room and a space not accounted for by any room,
in which it is thought some monk or nun was
immured when the abbey was a house of God&mdash;be
that as it may, no investigation has ever been
made, and it will probably never be known what,
if any, grisly horror is immured there, so near
to our gay laughter.</p>

<p class="pmb3">We spend some time discussing tea and the
usual assortment of cake. I never could digest
the English fruit cake and I feel quite sure the
slab pressed upon me here would kill a man if it
struck him upon a vital spot. Most of it goes into
my pocket, and when we depart I drop it deep
down in a bed of blooming plants near the door,
an action observed by Boyse, who, until I threaten
his life in a gloomy whisper, insists upon examining
with the hostess that particular spot, professing
a great knowledge of botany, of which his
ignorance is colossal. Whilst I am guarding my
buried cake, our attention is called to what once
was the north transept of the abbey and afterwards
for centuries the library of those who have
lived here. It is still a library and full of books,
but for some ungiven reason has been walled up
for many, many years,&mdash;the books, I am told,
mouldering in great heaps on the floor.</p>

<p>My desire to explore is intense but, it is useless
to say, unexpressed in this instance.</p>

<p>From this court started the funeral procession
of the gentleman who had been laid out on the
dining table. The cortège was so immense that
it circled away for three miles, though it is not
half a mile to the family vault. Every man was
provided with hat band and gloves at the expense
of the widow. At the feast which followed that
great table in the dining hall was decked in the
centre with a huge bow of crêpe, black of course.
The roast fowls had crêpe bows tied around their
necks and as the old butler served the whiskey
he did so with tears streaming down his face. As
he carried the bottle, also decked with a crêpe
bow, he gave utterance to the mournful words,
as the whiskey sobbed gurgling forth, "Ah, sor,
'tis this bottle will miss him indade, indade."
But those around were determined that, for the
day at least, they would drown its sorrow, and
when they went home "there wasn't wan of them
knew whether he was going backwards or forwards,
and most of them wint sideways."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The chapel on the hill yonder must even then
have been roofless and in decay. To-day it is in a
choke of brambles and wild roses. Bidding the car
to follow, we cross the park and mount to where
it stands, an absolute ruin.</p>

<p>We "give Boyse a leg" to a broken casement and
he clambers in and down amongst the brambles
up to his neck, and making his way towards the
high altar reads aloud of Sir Anthony Colclough,
who died in 1584, he to whom Queen Elizabeth
made the grant.</p>

<p>There are many other tablets embowered in
creeping, drooping vines, and almost obliterated
by the moss of centuries, while a great tree fuchsia
hangs in wildest profusion, shaking its crimson
blossoms downward upon the ruined altar. Wandering
around, pushing our way through brambles,
and stumbling over forgotten graves, we come
upon the family vault, underneath and as large as
the chapel. The door being open, we wandered
in and paused amazed at the spectacle of dead
humanity.</p>

<p>Outside the sunlight flickered downward
through waving branches, casting long lines of
light into the place of the dead, lighting up a sight
such as may be seen only in southern Ireland. The
entire space was crowded with coffins in all stages
of appalling decay and ruin and dating all the way
along from the reign of Elizabeth. At our feet
lay the ruin of a large coffin, its handles still clinging
to its sides. The skeleton within had vanished
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>
absolutely except the beautiful teeth,
evidently a woman's, which gleamed white in
the sunlight. The lid, cast to one side, left all
open to the light of day and passing of moonlight
or storms. Beyond were two still perfect coffins
of later date, and yet farther in where the shadows
were thicker rose the ruins of coffin on coffin, all
tumbling pell-mell into one wild chaos. Pausing
in silent dismay for an instant only, we went forth
into the sunshine, leaving the dead to their rest.</p>

<p>Only in Ireland may one come upon like scenes,
where the doors are not closed even after death.
I had often read of such spots, but scarcely believed
the tales until to-day when we stumbled
quite by accident upon that open door and entered,
and certainly I shall never forget the sight.
We closed the portal as best we could. One can
only hope that the return of dust to dust may be
not delayed, and that all that therein is may vanish
utterly.</p>

<p>As we roll away the sunlight streams brilliantly
aslant, lighting up the ruined chapel and the old
abbey, while the great trees stand all about them
like Druids deep in thought.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="pmb3">A rapid rush through the mists of Ireland will
so drive the cold air into one's system that after
dinner it is difficult to keep awake and one is apt
to doze off while sitting upright in the drawing-room
and to dream dreams and see visions, especially
after our afternoon's experience. Here
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
to-night in the drawing-room my book has fallen
upon my knees and I have almost passed to the
land of nod when some one suggests that we inspect
"King Charles's clothes," and being but half
awake I wonder when he arrived and whether he
will permit such familiarity, and then the questions
"which Charles," and if "the first" of that name,
will he bring his head, cause me to come to my
full senses just as Boyse is drawing a long wooden
case from beneath a sofa. When it is opened all
the room is filled with a faint perfume, some
fragrance so long forgotten that one cannot give it
a name, and yet which calls to mind the frou-frou
of silks and the tapping of high-heeled shoes on
parquette floors, over which wax lights are shedding
a soft radiance while the air resounds to
stately music.</p>

<p>Let us transport ourselves mentally backwards
to the dark days of 1649. Penshurst, the
ancient seat of the Sidneys, a gift from Edward
VI., when the tragedy of Charles Stuart was over
and the axe had fallen at Whitehall, his sister the
Queen of Bohemia, bowed with sorrow for the
past and undoubtedly with fear for the future,
divided as precious relics amongst those who had
been faithful, the belongings of the late King.
These before me she gave to Mr. Spencer, the
ancestor of our hostess here in Bannow House.
Mr. Spencer was then acting for Algernon Sidney,
who was a prisoner in the Tower. The relics came
into the possession of the present owner through
her father, the Rev. Thos. Harvey of Cowden
Rectory, Kent, and as they are drawn forth one
by one from their hiding place, I glance involuntarily
over my shoulder and out into the misty
night, almost expecting to see the shadowy face
of the King questioning our right to these things
of his, while the faces on the walls about have
awakened to life and express a strong desire to
come down and join us in the inspection. Here,
in a shagreen case, is a huge silver camp watch
which has long since ceased to mark the passage
of time and the vanity of princes. Yonder is a
silk dove-coloured coat and a waistcoat brocaded
in rose colour, black, and silver. Here is a pair of
breeches in brown figured silk and another of red
and white cut velvet. There are some quaint gold
embroidered slippers with great bows and high
heels and as I stand them on the floor they seem to
have been used but yesterday and are expecting to
be used again, and I glance once more into the
outer shadows. At the bottom of the chest are
two long rolls of illuminated vellum illustrating
the marriage of the Queen of Bohemia, called
the "Queen of Hearts" by the people who loved
her well. As I look at the painted procession, my
hand rests on a lace ruffle of King Charles, which
he may have worn on that occasion.</p>

<p>It was all so very long ago that I think we have
in our unconscious thoughts almost arrived at the
conclusion that these and many of the famous
personages of history are but the fanciful figures
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>
of fiction after all, and it is only when we look
upon this frayed doublet which seems but just
cast aside by its wearer, or pick up yonder glove
which still holds the curve of his palm and shape
of his fingers, that the belief is forced upon us
that, like ourselves, he once lived and breathed,
enjoyed and suffered, was really of flesh and blood.</p>

<p>Yet what was this Charles, warm-hearted and
generous, or proud, dictatorial, and utterly unreasonable,
holding the divine right of kings so
far above the rights of his people that they were
forced to lay low his head? Which view is the
correct one?&mdash;for with him, as with all others of
history, there seems a doubt. In fact doubts are
being cast upon the pages of history from all sides
to-day. Writers make Lucretia and Cæsar Borgia
far different from the scribes of a century ago,
and possessed of no desire to assist people to a
better world. She, for instance, is now held to
have been a model wife and loving mother. Also
we read that Richard of England was not deformed,
either in person or character, but because
of the very doubtful legitimacy of the sons of
Edward IV. was the real heir to the crown, and
so summoned by Parliament,&mdash;that he did not
murder or have murdered Henry VI., the Duke
of Clarence, or the Princes, and that the latter
lived at his court many years&mdash;in fact that he
was no such character as we have been raised to
believe; and, more marvellous to relate, that the
real villain of that period was Henry VII. of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>
blessed memory,&mdash;that he and he alone imported
historians from Italy who at the royal bidding
wrote history as it has been read for so many
centuries, that he was the murderer of both King
and Princes and of the Duke of Clarence. Surely
we shall shortly have the Jew of Venice made a
generous character, possessing deep love for all
Christians, whilst the eighth Henry will repose
in a glorious effulgency as a model husband as
Froude would have us believe. But they are
all of the so very long ago that they appear to
us like figures in a painted window, brilliant or
sombre, as the sunshine or shadows of history
illumine or cast them into shade, and it is only
when we see such a thing as this glove of Charles
or a half-worn shoe of the Scottish Queen that
they walk out upon us and take their places as
real men and women.</p>

<p>And so one feels near the presence of that unfortunate
Stuart King, as these belongings of his
lie spread out before us. What a small man he
was! These things might be worn by a boy of
fifteen,&mdash;a delicate boy of slight frame. They
are of great value as such things go, which reminds
one that the world holds much of great value of
its dead kings and queens. It is estimated that
the relics of Mary Stuart collected together at the
tercentenary in Peterborough in 1887 amounted
in value to sixty thousand pounds sterling, three
hundred thousand dollars of our money, and yet
she was often forced to write imploring letters to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
her "brother of France" for her revenues from
her fair duchy of Touraine, in order that she might
keep out the cold in her English prisons, and
whilst she was the guest of her "good sister
Elizabeth."</p>

<p class="pmb3">Did her grandson wear these silks and velvets
during those sad days at St. James's Palace? He
would almost require the attendance of a body
servant to carry that watch and surely no man
who appeared in such ruffles and high-heeled
fancy shoes to-day could induce an army to fight
for him, be he the anointed of God or not,&mdash;but
then, that clothes do not make the man was
certainly proven in his case, when "a man was a
man for a' that," the Puritans to the contrary
notwithstanding. I doubt if he thought much of
his fuss and feathers or paid as much attention
to them as said Puritans did to their sober browns,
or some rulers of the Europe of to-day do to their
gaudy plumage. If Charles was vain, it was with
a vanity we can pardon, and far different from
that which floods the world with a string of portraits
in different uniforms and poses&mdash;but it is
late and even the shades of royalty cannot keep
us awake longer; still as we take our candles and
move upwards through the shadowy hallway I
seem to hear the stealthy fall of following footsteps
and turn suddenly, wondering&mdash;wondering.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>A year has rolled away since I wrote my last
line about this Emerald Isle,&mdash;a year of
sickness and suffering, brought about, most seem
to think, by the bubbling springs and cool wells
of this same island; at least B., who drank whiskey
and soda, passed scathless, while typhoid for the
second time seized upon my system and worked
its will for months and months. But that is over
and gone, and for another year at least I am immune.
Still I think that during this visit I shall
hold to soda and some whiskey, at least I am so
advised by a last telegram as my ship moves out
to sea.</p>

<p>If the Board of Trade knew of the state of
affairs on the great liners they would scarcely
permit it. Think of one hundred and sometimes
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>
one hundred and fifty stewards crowded into a
confined space below the saloon with <i>one</i> bathroom
only. They are only allowed on deck way
back amongst the emigrants, and from there they
come to the main saloon to wait on the first-class
passengers, running the risk of carrying all sorts
of contagious diseases; no air, no ventilation to
speak of. The deck stewards are somewhat
better off, being only six in a room, but no better
ventilated than the pen referred to. If things
are so on an English ship, what must they not be
upon an Italian!</p>

<p>It blew great guns, and rained in torrents as we
landed at Queenstown. The <i>Campania</i> came in
just behind the <i>Baltic</i> and between the two nearly
two thousand passengers were landed. The accommodations
both in tenders and at the custom
house are in every way inadequate, and the confusion
was appalling.</p>

<p>However, all was passed and done at last, and
ten <span class="smcap">P. M.</span> finds me at the Imperial in Cork, which
is in this rainy weather even more mouldy than
last year, but where B. and a whiskey and soda
make matters assume a more cheerful tone.
However as the house is crowded to suffocation
an excursion into the outer darkness has its attractions.
On our way out we remark to the barmaid
that it is rather stupid here to-night, and
she suggests that this being Saturday evening
if we will go down to the quay we may find some
diversion. Knowing that she would be correct
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
in her surmise as to other towns on that night and
at such places we conclude to try it in Cork and
sally forth, only to fall into the clutches of a car
boy, who absolutely refuses either to be left
behind or to allow us to walk. Hence we are
shortly mounted on that characteristic Irish
vehicle, a jaunting-car, and en route for wherever
its owner may see fit to take us.</p>

<p>Our suggestion of "the quay" evidently meets
with his approbation, and with a twinkle in his eye
and a blow for his horse, we set forth. The pace
is one which causes us to clutch the swinging car
for safety. That the streets are crowded matters
not at all to our jehu, and many is the anathema
hurled at our heads from the scattering populace&mdash;until
finally the crowd becomes so dense that our
pace is reduced perforce to a walk, and at last we
stop altogether. Just before us is a half-grown
boy celebrating the approach of the day of rest
to the best of his ability, and an odder figure I
have never seen. His tattered trousers are
rolled up above a pair of brogans which would fit
the Cardiff giant, the tails of what once was a
black coat of great size trail on the ground behind
him, while his dirty mug of a face has the stump
of a pipe fixed somewhere in the middle&mdash;I can
see no mouth&mdash;and is crowned by what was once
a silk hat, now by numerous blows and whacks
more resembling an opera hat semi-collapsed. In
his hand he twirls a shillalah, and as he croons a
ditty he wheels ever and anon to attack any
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
one who treads on the tails of his coat. Before
we have fully appreciated all of his good points
our attention is attracted by increased shouts and
the rush of the crowd down the quay, where
evidently Pat and Dinnis are at it hard and
fast.</p>

<p>How the hats fly! You can hear the whacks
of the shillalahs even from here. The dancing,
jeering, hooting, and howling crowd takes first
one side and then the other, "fightin aich uther
fur konciliation and hatin aich uther fur the love
o' God." Just about this time we think best to
retire, as good hats are too attractive in free
fights.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It has turned stormy again and the wind blows
in great gusts up the river from the sea. Shortly
after we start homeward a fishwife carrying her
loaded basket comes out from a doorway and up
a few steps onto the pavement, when the wind
taking her broadside blows her over backwards,
her legs sticking up in the air like two great lighthouses.
Of course the contents of her basket are
attacked by every gamin in sight, but the old
woman gets all the fish but one and she has a firm
hold on one end of that, while a sturdy boy holds
tight on to the tail. Then begins a tug of war,
resulting in an upset for the boy with half the
fish clutched in his fist. Quick as lightning she
seizes him and thoroughly washes his face with
the other half. The last glimpse I have of them
as we roll away she has turned him over her knees
and there is no indication of "konciliation" on
her face.</p>

<p>Verily&mdash;there is "something doing on the quay
at Cork of a Saturday evening."</p>

<p>Nine o'clock next morning brings our motor to
the hotel door. It is soon packed and, the word
given, is rolling away through the streets of the
city, which one moment laugh with sunshine and
the next weep with downpouring rain,&mdash;but bless
you, no one minds the rain in Ireland, certainly
not in Cork.</p>

<p>The music of the Bells of Shandon follows us
far out into the green lanes and winding highways
and the motor hums and sings in response as we
roll under the grand old trees with their curtains
of quivering ivy. Almost at once, things begin
to happen, and, as usual, an ancient dame is the
cause of war.</p>

<p>At the end of a long lane, over which the ivy
draped trees form a perfect archway, a donkey
cart driven by an old lady approaches us, and as
usual we produce consternation. With each leg
pointed towards one of the points of the compass
and with great ears slanting towards us, the little
beast is prepared against all attacks, and to run
in any direction, but he reckons without his mistress.
She does not propose that there shall be
any run at all, and quickly slides to the ground
from her perch in the cart&mdash;and in her progress
shows us that aside from her waist and woollen
skirt she is not encumbered with clothing. The
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
situation requires prompt action, and seizing her
skirt in both hands she rushes at the donkey and
claps it over his head. His surprise is intense
and deprives him of action. What he thinks I
know not, but as we roll by we distinctly hear a
suppressed "he-haw."</p>

<p>The distance to Fermoy is quickly covered,
and we pass in triumph the spot where last year
we broke down and were forced to take to jaunting-cars.</p>

<p>The Fusiliers who then were at Buttevant are
in Fermoy now, and we dine in the Mess.</p>

<p>The barracks are much alike in the two places,
but while this has no "green" for cricket and
croquet, Fermoy is quite a contrast to the wretched
town of Buttevant. Still all that sinks into nothingness
when it is stated that <i>that</i> is "a better
hunting country."</p>

<p>As of old, the officers endeavour to induce me
to spend a winter in that sport. Twenty years
ago I might have done so, but it's too late now,
though I have no doubt that if I lived here I
should try it regardless of the flight of years. I
have no doubt but that I could if necessary buy
hunters from each and all of them,&mdash;and I have
also no doubt but that they would loan me all
they have or may have if I would accept, which
I would not do.</p>

<p>This is Sunday morning, and his Majesty's
soldiers are going to church. The Church of
Rome claims the larger number and there are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>
some hundreds of scarlet coats marching past the
hotel now to the ever favourite and inspiring tune
of <i>Hiawatha</i>. How the fifes do seize upon and
rip out those notes and what joy there is in every
whack given by that great bass drummer! My
admiration of last year is intensified.</p>

<p>The officer in charge is a man I know very well
and I try my best to attract his attention, but
without success; discipline must be maintained,
and not a glance comes in my direction from under
his towering "bear skin," though I know that he
sees me. He owes me a grudge because, his
mother being an American, I tell him his coat
should be blue.</p>

<p>The streets have ceased to glitter with crimson
and gold, and the air has lost the tones of martial
music as we roll away,&mdash;only the murmur of the
river and the solemn music of the organ from an
ivy-clad church yonder breaks the stillness of this
sunny Sunday morning.</p>

<p>Not far from Fermoy stands a mansion which
is of interest to many in America, Killshening
House, one of the seats of Lord Fermoy. That
title will in time pass to an American boy, or man
as he will be then, though I doubt his ever assuming
it&mdash;certainly he will never occupy this house.
The present owner lives in a place belonging to his
wife, and as we enter the gates of Killshening,
we see at once that it is and has been long
deserted.</p>

<p class="pmb3">These abandoned houses greet the traveller all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>
over Ireland. This one has not been lived in for
some generations by the family. It does not pay
to keep up the house, and renting the land out as
pasturage brings more income than in any other
way. Still it is sad to find a stately mansion in
such a reduced state. The rusty gates have long
ceased to perform their function and stand deeply
imbedded in the grass-grown drive which stretches
inward toward the house. The trees have grown
wild at will and stretch their branches almost
across the drive. The grass is rank but still thick
and velvety and some sheep stare at our intrusion
and then scuttle away to a safe distance where
they stop huddled together and stare again. Hawthorn
hedges white with bloom enclose the place
almost like the palace of the sleeping beauty and
one wonders whether man has entered yonder
silent house for the last hundred years. It certainly
has not that appearance. Its windows have
a sightless, unoccupied look and its doors swing
open to the summer breezes. Except for the
sheep there is no sign of life anywhere and we
enter and roam at will through the deserted
rooms. In its exterior it is of the usual type of
such houses in Ireland, a stately rectangular
structure, probably of some two centuries of age.
Its portals are never closed, and passing inward,
one enters a large square hallway, whose fine
ceiling is supported by four stately columns.
Surrounding this are numerous living-rooms,
reception-and dining-rooms, and in several the
ceilings show much beauty even through the
mould and dirt of years of neglect.</p>

<p>Of those who made this place a home all have
long since passed beneath the "low green tent
whose curtains never outward swing" and those
who own it now have other houses more to their
taste, so this stands tenantless, the silence both
without and within broken only by the sound of
our footfalls as we explore the empty, echoing
spaces.</p>

<p>The park around is fine, but as we pass away
we note that nearly all the great timber has been
cut down.</p>

<p>It's a sad place, and even our motor seems
anxious to leave it.</p>

<p>Our car this year is a 16-20 Clement and on its
top speed runs as noiselessly as an electric. It
is not an especially good hill climber, though
that may be but a temporary fault, as sometimes
it sails up an incline with ease, while at others
balks at much lesser grades. On the whole I
like the car very much, and though two years old
and having had hard usage, with but small
expense it could be made as good as new. It is
certainly to be preferred to the Panhard of last
year and is more agreeable to ride in than the
sixty horse-power Mercedes of the Duke of M.
In those high power cars, unless at full speed,
which is impossible on most Irish roads, one is
disagreeably conscious of the power beneath one,
and rather dreads a breaking away with its ensuing
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
destruction. Certainly but few of these Irish
roads are suited to a speed of sixty miles per hour.
This car comes from Wayte Bros., of Dublin, and
costs twenty pounds per month less than that of
last season.</p>

<p>Our onward route lies over the hills to Fethard
through Clonmel and across the river Moyle. As
we enter, we encounter a funeral, and I notice
that they are carrying the corpse round and round
what is certainly the town pump. Later I learn
that a cross once stood there, also that through
the gate by which Cromwell entered the town the
dead are never carried.</p>

<p>Boyse has a sister living here, and we pass the
night in her home.</p>

<p>Fethard is one of those quaint Irish places
which the world, unless it hunts the fox, never
comes near,&mdash;but the Irish world does hunt the
fox and hence everybody that is anybody comes
to Fethard.</p>

<p>As I wandered out into the meadows behind
the mews, I came upon a pile of coffins under a shed,&mdash;new
and awaiting occupants. Evidently they
are bought by the wholesale here and of assorted
sizes against emergencies. Near-by stood the
village hearse, and backed up against a hayrick
the remains of the worn-out one which had ceased
from its labors. My remark that the "coffins were
cheap and thin" brought out the rejoinder, "Ah,
they're good enough, give the worms a chance."
So wears the world away. The reply came from
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
an old man smoking a stump of a pipe, and
calmly reposing the while in a pine box, the
future use of which could not be a matter of
doubt.</p>

<p>Leaving him to his repose I enter the motor and
with my host and hostess and B. roll off through
Clonmel to the superb estate of the Marquis of W.,
"Curraghmore House," the location of which at
once strikes the beholder as very superb. Lofty
hills, rich dales, and almost impenetrable woods
surround him in all directions. The home park
alone holds some twenty-seven hundred acres,
entirely enclosed by a high stone wall.</p>

<p>As we approach the gates we see on a distant
hill a lofty tower erected in memory of one of
the heirs, who as a boy broke his neck while attempting
to jump his horse over the gate just before
us, and which is to-day opened to our sounding
horn by a smiling old lady, who curtsies deeply as
we pass her.</p>

<p>Three gates are encountered before we enter
the court of Curraghmore House, where we hear
that "His Lordship is down at the kennels," and
so roll away again through the aisles of such trees
as only these ancestral places can show, save in
California or a primeval forest where the vandal,
man, has not had his way. How beautiful it is!
The wide white avenues roll and twist away over
the deep rich grass. Yonder valley is a mass of
blossoming rhododendrons,&mdash;tree fuchsias bloom
on the other hand,&mdash;and across the river the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>
green hills mount away, dotted with sheep, to a
fair blue sky.</p>

<p>We cross an ancient bridge of stone with the
water gurgling deliciously beneath as it flows
off down a lane brilliant with the lilac of the
rhododendrons.</p>

<p>The kennels are probably the most extensive
in Ireland and resemble a large carnivora house in
some zoölogical garden,&mdash;even to the iron cages
for summer use.</p>

<p>Here, amidst more than a hundred hounds, we
find our host. Of an ancient Irish family, tall,
very fair, with close cropped yellow hair and blue
eyes, and clad in a long white linen coat, his appearance
is very English, which remark would not
please him at all I am told. He is making a register
of his hounds for the dog show at Peterborough
next month.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Each hound is presented, passed upon, and has
her name duly entered on the list. I am told
that the dog does not make a good hunter in Ireland,
and hence all of the one hundred and twelve
animals here are bitches. [Perhaps that is always
the case, if so you will discover that I am not a
sportsman.] If you were to stumble and fall while
near them they would promptly tear you to pieces,
though they are friendly enough and almost every
one, as she passes through the cage, pokes her
nose into our hands.</p>

<p>These dogs actually seem to know what is being
said about them. When they passed muster
they jumped away like a boy through with his
examinations,&mdash;but there were two or three which
did not pass, and the look of reproach cast upon
their keeper as he told of their failings was almost
human.</p>

<p>The registering done with, they are let out in
two lots on the hillside, and crowd around us,
still friendly apparently, but as we turn to leave&mdash;the
hounds having been caged again&mdash;I drop my
stick, and when I stoop to pick it up the whole
pack spring at the bars in a wild attempt to get
at me. I do not regret the protecting iron.</p>

<p>These kennels are beautifully kept, and the
oatmeal cakes on the shelves of the feed house
would taste very good, I fancy. In fact I am
bidden to try one.</p>

<p>We motor back through the domain to the
grounds back of the house and walk across them
to enter the mansion. They are beautifully laid
off, but I think the huge bronze fountain in the
centre is a mistake,&mdash;a simple stone basin with a
majestic geyser of water would be more in keeping
with the age of the place and the simple and
severe outlines of the house. Like most of the
great fountains there is too much bronze and too
little water.</p>

<p>Curraghmore House was built about 1700,
around the remains of a very ancient castle.
From this side the building somewhat resembles
Chatsworth, but on the other one sees the great
square tower which dates from the twelfth century.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>
It has been, of course, much changed and
is now outwardly made to conform to the rest of
the mansion,&mdash;but upon entering you at once
notice the great thickness of the walls which prove
its age. They are adorned with trophies of the
chase of much interest.</p>

<p>Mounting a staircase of gradual ascent one
enters another square hall around which are the
living-rooms, some very rich in ornamentation,
especially in the painted ceilings. Many portraits
gaze questioningly at me from the walls, some so
dark with age that only the eyes are visible, eyes
in a pallid face and all else lost in the shadow,&mdash;faces
whose owners have come and gone like the
shadows of a dream, and whose very names are
now forgotten;&mdash;living, I fancy, their lives out
in these old halls, with as little thought for the
inevitable forgetfulness of time, as we have to-day,
and we have none at all, but pass the time in a
happy fashion over tea in the Library.</p>

<p>Some of us wander off to the billiard hall up in
the great tower, and descending stop a moment in
a room which it is claimed is visited by such a
ghostly caller as Scott tells of in his "Tapestried
chamber,"&mdash;one which will wake you and jibe at
you. Here is a portrait of a lady, with a band on
her wrist. She and a brother lived long ago and
were both atheists. The brother became converted
to a belief in God but not this sister, and
he promised that when he died if there was a God
and a hereafter, he would return, which he did,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
and seizing his sister by the wrist left a mark which
necessitated the wearing of this band. There it
is in that portrait over the mantel in the ghost's
room.</p>

<p>There are other phantoms which haunt this
mansion of Curraghmore, but let this suffice. I
should like to have slept in that room, and after
we departed I was told that we had all been asked
to "stay the night," but the ladies of the party
objected as Lady W. was absent.</p>

<p>Many years ago en route from Calcutta to Ceylon
we had on board a poor sick man en route to
colder climes in the hope of prolonging his life&mdash;a
vain one as it proved. He was brought out
daily and laid on the deck and naturally became
an object of interest and sympathy to all of the
passengers. One elderly lady was especially kind
to him and I held many long conversations with
her. She told me that he had been in the employ
of the government in the Indian Islands, and,
stricken with fever, had been ordered home,
leaving a wife and a newly born child behind him.
As I left the ship at Colombo I saw her standing
by his side fanning him. Poor man&mdash;he was buried
at sea near Aden and to-day I find <i>her</i> portrait
looking down upon me from these walls. She
was Lady Waterford, the grandmother of our
host, a woman who believed in seeing the world
and, as I know, doing good as she passed along.
I believe she was considered rather eccentric&mdash;interesting
people generally are so,&mdash;and it is
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
stated that she discarded all the family jewels in
favour of one made of foxes' teeth. Although
eighteen years had elapsed since that sea trip
hers was not a face to be forgotten, and I knew
it at once. I believe she has long since passed
away.</p>

<p>There is a story told of the castle in Cromwell's
day which, while it proves that there is a woman
at the bottom of most incidents in this world,
shows that here her wits were the salvation of the
house. Knowing that her father would die rather
than surrender to the king-killer, she seduced the
lord of the manor into one of his own dungeons
and promptly locked him up. Into Cromwell's
hands she then delivered the keys of the castle,
assuring him that though forced to be absent on
this auspicious occasion her father was nevertheless
well disposed to the cause of Parliament and
willing to give such proof as the Protector might
demand. In consequence Curraghmore remained
unimpaired in the possession of its owner, securely
locked up the while in his own dungeon.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Taking it all in all it is a most interesting place,
yet when all is said, to my thinking, the greatest
beauty lies in the superb trees of the park, and
its wonderful stretches of grassland.</p>

<p>The next day opens nasty and wet. Leaving
our benediction and thanks with Mr. and
Mrs. P. we roll off through the drops of rain
over the muddy roadways. It is not especially
pleasant and conversation lags, but it must be a
bad day indeed to suppress all chances for excitement
in Ireland, as we shortly discover.</p>

<p>Turning a bend of the road we see, coming
towards us, a jaunting-car, hauled by a bay horse
and driven by an old man. The nag gives evidence
of fright and our motor is stopped instantly
at some three hundred feet from her. The old
man succeeds in turning her around and at our
suggestion unwinds himself from his lap-robe and
gets down to hold her. All the time our car is at
a standstill and making no sound. Whether the
old chap got tangled in the reins or stumbles, I
know not, but the nag plunges, knocking him
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
down, then plunges again and falls against a stone
wall, breaking a shaft. B. gets out of our car and
suggests that I go back to the town just behind
and bring a policeman as there will surely be
claims for damages. I cannot see how, as we
have not been in motion for the past fifteen minutes
and certainly have an equal right upon the
highroads. However, I roll away, and en route I
notice a travelling circus with a nigger in charge
who grins at me. The policeman secured and
brought back in the car, we find to our amazement
that the horse is dead, and the nigger and owner
are already haggling over the sale of its carcass.
The latter wants a sovereign and the former offers
half a crown.</p>

<p>What killed the beast is unknown to us to this
day; it certainly did not break its neck as it kicked
and plunged a lot after it was down. However,
it is dead, and there is trouble in consequence.
Of course we are "entirely to blame" though the
accident did not occur until we had been stationary
for some fifteen minutes, and until the old man had
had ample time to argue with the horse and then
to turn her around and move away from us before
he got down, at which time she was perfectly
quiet. It's my opinion that he became tangled
in the reins and fell against her. Fact remains
that she neither scared nor plunged until he got
down from the car and made for her head, and
as I have stated before, I have often noticed that
horses are more frightened by their owner's
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
sudden grabs at the bridle than by the motor
car.</p>

<p>I had once a saddle horse which could never
be induced to pass a piece of paper be it ever so
small without violent shying, and I could at any
instant, by pressing my knee suddenly into the
saddle, cause him to look round for such objects
and shy violently in advance.</p>

<p>So it is with most car horses,&mdash;let alone they
would stand quietly; grabbed at by the driver they
plunge and shy. As far as our car is concerned it
always comes at once to a dead halt if there is the
smallest evidence of trouble. We did so, as I
have stated, in this case, yet I have no doubt damage
or blackmail will have to be paid. If this were
not done and B. ever wanted to hunt over this
country he would come to dire disaster, as our
names and addresses were taken down by the policeman,
and will never be forgotten but stored
away to be remembered either in blessing or malediction
according as we pay or not.</p>

<p>This being a rented car the owners assume all
such risks, and on reaching Dublin we learn that
a claim for twenty-five pounds has already been
presented, the value of the beast having increased
by leaps and bounds, and I doubt not before the
year is out will have passed that of the winner
of the Derby.</p>

<p>I should like to have been at the trial if it came
to that, if only to count the witnesses that would
have sprung up by the dozens, undoubtedly proving
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
in the end that the old man was driving two
horses to that jaunting-car and that our appearance
killed them both.</p>

<p>The day after that occurrence the driver of a
cow deliberately placed her in our pathway in
hopes that we would kill her, but he reckoned
without our brakes, which stopped the car not a
foot from the cow. Her owner laughed in a
stupid, leering fashion as we rolled away.</p>

<p>After the death of the poor old horse, which no
one could have regretted more than we did, nothing
occurred during the ride to Dublin.</p>

<p class="pmb3">As we approach the city, the highways are of
greater width and in better condition, though
most of the Irish roads are good. There are motor-cars
flying in all directions now and ours catching
the disease skims along like a bird, and quite as
noiselessly, until the pavements and narrower
streets of the city force a reduction of speed, and
even then the rate is more rapid than I like.</p>

<p>Dublin is in the throes of an exposition, and
there is "no room in the inn." Not to be forced
to sleep in a manger we direct our course to Bray
Head, and in her very comfortable hotel of that
name are at rest for a few days. While there are
no real mountains in this section of Ireland the
hills and headlands are very bold and beautifully
outlined. The roads are fine and there are many
points of interest hereabouts. To-day we have
been rambling over Kilruddery, the fine estate
of the Earl of Meath. The house, while modern,
has not that appearance, and at first I thought it
must date at least from the days of the good Queen
Bess during whose reign the property passed into
the hands of this family. It is of that period in
its architecture, but the great glory lies all around
it. These grounds are justly famous. I have
never seen more beautiful, stately hedges even at
Versailles, and one rather feels that one should
be dressed in the fashion of the Grand Monarque
to pace these grassy lanes. At one point the
hedges, thirty feet high, spread off like the spokes
of a wheel, and the legend runs that in ancient
days the abbot had his cell in that centre from
where the brethren living down the aisles could
be easily watched, and being human, even if
saintly, I doubt not that they needed watching
now and then.</p>

<p>In front of the mansion two oblong lakes nestle
in the velvety grass like great mirrors and on their
waters numerous swans are floating. One old
general mounts the bank and with arched neck
and spreading wings advances to attack us, but
we do not risk the battle. Those male birds can
strike hard, and while it might be possible to seize
and stretch their necks, the Lord of the Manor does
not like that to be done. So we take refuge in the
flower garden, a perfect glory of bloom and colour.</p>

<p>Later on, as we are at tea in the "long drawing-room
before my lady's picture," the old swan
raises his head just outside in watchful ward lest
we dare to come out.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>I think Dickens must have visited Kilruddery
about the time he wrote <i>Bleak House</i>, though he
placed the scene of his great work in Lincolnshire.
Here are the long drawing-rooms with my
lady's picture over the mantle before which Sir
Leicester sat in such grandeur; yonder is the
window through which the moonlight streamed
upon my lady seated at the open casement, and
just here between my lord and my lady Mr. Tulkinghorn
must have paced as he "told my story to
so many people." Just outside runs the Ghost
Walk where upon that fatal night the step grew
louder and louder, and above one can doubtless
find Mr. Tulkinghorn's chamber opening out
upon the leads, and where he met and cowed my
lady. This may not be the place which the great
writer had in mind, but it might well have been.</p>

<p>I confess to an intense envy when I visit these
superb estates, not so much as to the houses,
unless they are very ancient, but certainly as to
the parks. It is perhaps well that our country
cannot know such,&mdash;it certainly never will unless
the law of primogeniture is established, which
God forbid. And yet here the younger members
of a family seem to think it but right and just that
everything should pass to but one of them, that
they, who may love and appreciate their lifelong
home as perhaps the heir never will, should be
turned out, often with nothing, while, as often,
he proceeds to pile debt on debt until the old home
goes by the board and passes to strangers or the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
great trees are cut down to pay gambling debts.
All this may be gall and wormwood to some of
them but if so they are loyal to the rules of their
order and murmur not at all.</p>

<p>It is necessary for B. to return to Bannow for
a day as he is a magistrate there and has some
business in consequence. So we are off in the
forenoon and shall run the hundred miles by tea-time
with several stops thrown in. We enter
amongst the hills on starting and are amongst
them all day save for sudden dips into some valley
or down to the sea.</p>

<p>As we speed up the mountains the prospects
behind are enchanting. The valleys are deep and
very green while on the other side of one amphitheatre
the vast mansion of "Powers Court
House," where we shall spend the week-end, stands
half way up the hillside in a most beautiful location.
From here it appears to be a stone structure of
several stories, with long wings on either hand,
and even at this distance one can see that the
garden and park are very extensive.</p>

<p>Our route southward to Bannow lies through
the mountains of Wicklow, which here resemble
Arthur's Seat and other hills around Edinburgh.
Fortunately the day is fine and the roads dry
without dust, but one never suffers from the dust
of one's own car and we do not meet any others,
hence the ride is exhilarating and beautiful, especially
as we approach Glendalough, where the
scenery is almost Alpine.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>That ancient place lies in a deep valley with
mountains towering all around it. Its ruined
churches are presided over by one of the tallest
and most perfect round towers in Ireland.</p>

<p>Wherever one sees those strange structures
they are objects of interest and this one, rising in
stately watch and ward over the dead who sleep
all around it, is unusually so. It stands in an
enclosure so choked with graves that one must
walk over the dead to reach it. Two, lately buried
I should say, seem to have used the old tower as
their especial monument, so closely are their heads
placed against its ancient base. A little wooden
cross between the graves protests that those who
sleep beneath are of the faith of the Nazarene
and not of that of the long-dead heathens who,
some claim, erected this and all other similar
towers in this land, a false idea of course.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Glendalough is very ancient, and dates its
foundation back in 618 <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> St. Kevin of the
royal house of Leinster died here at a great age,
having lived for years in a hollow tree near the
lake and in a cave, to which there was no access
save by a boat. His memory has been honored
for centuries, and in the peculiar manner of much
drinking and many free fights here on the spot
where he died, a custom stopped by the parish
priest who emptied the whiskey into the stream
and burned the shillalahs, after which he forced
these people who had been enemies for centuries
to embrace over Kevin's grave. He lived to the
age of one hundred and twenty years, founding
here what became a crowded city, with schools,
colleges, sanctuaries for the saintly, and asylums
for the poor and sick.</p>

<p>Glendalough began to decline more than six
centuries ago, and to-day holds nothing save a
few ruined churches, the stately round tower, and
many graves deep down in its vale, guarded by
the brooding mountains. Its silence is rarely
broken except when one more is added to the
quiet company which lies around, or when some
wanderer from the outer world remembers that
Glendalough has been and pauses a moment to
offer devotions at her crumbling shrines.</p>

<p>How completely one's thoughts shift from the
ancient heathen history of this island to gentler
times and songs, waving trees, sunlight, and the
music of waters as the car rolls through the
Vale of Ovoca, where gentle Tom Moore's
spirit still seems to be singing of its bubbling
streams.</p>

<p>Stop at the old stone bridge and lean a while
upon its parapets and you will be just over the
tree, now a gaunt dead skeleton with all its glory
gone, where he wrote the poems so dear to all of us.
Beneath you murmurs one of the streams, and,
just beyond, it rushes joyously to its meeting with
the other, and the old tree stands on a point at
the meeting place. The waters plash and sing
and dance away and away, the years have rolled
by, and the poet is gone, but his verses live on for
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
ever, and pilgrims from all over the world come
to this spot which he found beautiful.</p>

<p>To-day as we roll up there are a party of women
all from my own land, I should judge, and each
takes her seat for a moment under the great
skeleton where Moore sat and wrote his songs for
mankind.</p>

<p>The east and west sides of Ireland are very
different. On the latter lies all the grandeur
and ruggedness, as though nature had been
carved and hewn by the tremendous blows of the
North Atlantic's winds and waves, and all the
music is wild and weird; while on the eastern side
all is like a beautiful park, pastoral and full of
sunshine and flowers. Moore's melodies sound
all around one and if a lad or lassie sings in passing
it will be of Robin Adair or Aileen Aroon. The
former lived just back there in Hollybrook House
and the latter dwells all over the mountains and
down in every vale.</p>

<p>The entire ride from Bray to Bannow is over
fine roads and affords constant panoramas of
sunlight, seas, and stretches of woodlands and
grass-lands, with here and there a stately mansion
keeping ward over a beautiful park and with
many gushing, bubbling rivers and brooks. The
air is laden with the perfume of the sweet grasses,
and the way is bordered by blossoming hawthorns
and wild roses. Quaint villages and ancient cities
nestle by the sea, whose waters murmur peacefully,
forgetful that storms have ever been.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span></p>

<p>With the rapid flight of the motor, new life
rushes through one's veins, and surely some years
must drop away.</p>

<p>It is an error to imagine that an automobile
tour means merely a rapid flight through the
country. It may be made just that, and no doubt
often is, but on the other hand it will be found
that those who love to travel, love antiquities,
are students of history, will see far more by the
use of a car than would have been possible with
stage-coach or by rail. By the former, progress
was slow, and so tedious often that many points
of great interest were given up because of the
bodily weariness necessary in reaching them.
With rail I know, from personal experience, that
I allowed years to pass without visiting points
which I greatly longed to see, because it necessitated
change of trains and weary waiting in dirty
stations. With a motor one is possessed almost
of Aladdin's lamp. Make your wish, turn a crank,
glide over the earth almost as rapidly as the owner
of the lamp did through the air, and behold you
have your heart's desire, and so you have many
desires of the heart and spy out the land as you
never would have done in days gone by,&mdash;days
which seem so long gone by, though but a few
years have passed since those old modes of transit
were the only ones known. You may go as slowly
as you desire in a motor, you cannot in a
train. You are able also to glide rapidly over
long, tedious roads of no interest, where with
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
horses hours of wearisome journey would be
necessary.</p>

<p>So, my dear critic, don't condemn a book of
notes written from a motor until you have tried
that method of locomotion and found it wanting,
which, to my thinking, will never occur. This
journey to Bannow, but better still my inspection
of the island of Achill is a case in point. Not
satisfied with my first visit, I determined to return.
I was then in Wexford, quite on the other side of
the island, but that was, with a motor, no barrier.
I simply crossed the island in a day's run, spent
another day in Achill, and returned to Wexford.</p>

<p>Had the time been twenty years or ten years
ago, the trouble of a second visit would have
destroyed all chances of making it.</p>

<p>It is very dreamy and poetic to sigh over the
old dead days, but it's all bosh. The modern appliances
of the twentieth century enable the
traveller to see more and at his leisure in one summer
than he would ever have dreamed of seeing
in those "dear old dead days."</p>

<p class="pmb3">The time will come when these machines will be
made for the people and general utility. I venture
to quote here an article from <i>Harper's Weekly</i>
as to the future of this great invention.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"When a man takes hold of the knob of his office
door he knows that, year in and year out, the knob
will perform its proper function. When the housewife
sits down to her sewing-machine she knows that
hardly once in a thousand times will it fail to do its
work, and do it well. Unreliable is an indictment
to which our cars must too often plead guilty. In
America we have done a lot of foolish things in motor-car
building, but we are approaching saner methods
and more correct lines. The car of the future, either
for business or pleasure, has not yet been laid down.
He would be a bold, perhaps a rash, prophet who
would undertake any detailed description of this car.
Nevertheless, reasoning <i>a priori</i>, there are some
features we may prognosticate. In the first place,
it will be built of better steel than we have been
accustomed to use. In the next place, the cars will
become standardized, and when standardized they
will be built by machinery in enormous quantities
at an exceedingly low cost. The wheels will be large,
built of wood and of the artillery type. Hard rubber
or some enduring substance will take the place of the
present high-priced unsatisfactory pneumatic tires.
The car will be light, simple, strong, and easily kept
in repair. Mr. Edison once said the automobile will
never be wholly practical until it is fool-proof and
the ordinary repairs can be made on the highway by a
darky with a monkey-wrench. The present highly
unsatisfactory system of change-speed gears will be
supplanted by a variable speed device. There are
not wanting good judges who believe that the problem
will be solved by a system of hydraulic transmission.
The fuel of the future will be kerosene or grain alcohol.
Thirty-five per cent, of the population of
America are farmers. The farmer will be the chief
automobile owner and user. The maximum speed
of his car may be only twenty miles per hour, but
that is twice as fast as his present mode of travel.
The car will be an invaluable adjunct to his work on
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
the farm. The adjustment of a belt, the turn of a
crank, and the automobile engine furnishes power
to thresh his grain, cut his wood, chop his feed, and
pump his water. After being in constant use all the
day, the car is ready to take the entire family to the
social gathering in the village at night, or to church
services on Sunday morning. The farmer will use
the automobile as will the butcher, the baker, and the
storekeeper&mdash;when he can in no other way get the
same amount of work done at so low a cost; and when
the business man can deliver his goods more quickly
and more economically than he can by using the horse
he will do so.</p>

<p>"There will always be motor-cars de luxe for the
rich, but they will be merely the fringe of the garment
of a great industry. The countless millions of tons
of freight now slowly and painfully drawn over country
roads and through city streets by poor dumb
brutes will go spinning along, the motors of the heavily
laden trucks humming a tune of rich content, and
all the thousand tongues of commerce will sing the
praises of the motor-car.</p>

<p>"Let me suggest a few practical things that the tireless
horse of the future will accomplish:</p>

<p>"1. It will solve the problem of the over congestion
of traffic in our city streets.</p>

<p>"2. It will free the horse from his burdens. A few
years ago, in the city of New Orleans, an old darky
came in from the country and for the first time saw
the electric street cars, which had taken the place of
the mule-drawn car. The old darky threw up his
hands, and looking up to heaven said, 'Bless de Lord,
de white man freed de nigger, now he done freed the
mule.'</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>


<p>"3. The automobile will furnish relief to the tenement
house districts.</p>

<p>"4. It will stimulate the good roads movement
throughout the United States.</p>

<p>"5. It will save time and space and become
invaluable to many classes of citizens.</p>

<p>"6. It will tend to break down class distinction,
because one touch of automobilism makes the whole
world kin."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The motor has come to stay-rest assured of
that. It has an equal right upon the highway
under the law of the land, with all other vehicles or
animals, so spare yourselves your curses and your
ill temper, which only injure yourselves.&mdash;A
stoppage for luncheon allowed me time to bring
in all that, but we are miles onward by now.</p>

<p>In addition to song and story, superstition,
perhaps of a harmless sort, certainly reigns in
Ireland, at least in the southern parts. Even B.
never sees a magpie that he does not cast his eyes
and hands aloft in supplication, to exorcise the
evil results of the encounter. I have always
understood that the legends of that famous bird
ran "one for luck, two for joy, three for a wedding,
and four for a boy." But B. insists that the
appearance of one means misfortune; however
"maggies" are eminently domestic and travel in
pairs. Marriage is not a failure with them.</p>

<p>While B. is stoutly maintaining his belief in
the ill luck sure to follow the appearance of a bird
just now flirting his tail at us from a tree near-by,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>
the car comes to a sudden halt and Robert's face
plainly indicates something wrong. With an "I
told you so" B. gets out to inspect. Knowing
nothing and caring less about machinery I stay
where I am; the seat is comfortable and paid for,
whether in motion or not; if they want to get down
on their backs in that mud they can do so, I
won't. While the work is in progress I question
B. on the matter of superstition and am told that
no real Irishman would, in case of death in his
house, go after the coffin <i>alone</i>,&mdash;that "must never
be done." Many even in these days will place a
lighted candle in the hands of the dying to light
them to Heaven, and at a wake there is always
a plate of snuff on the corpse.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Not long since, a stranger desiring to attend one
of these weird affairs was conducted to the house
of a man who&mdash;it was stated&mdash;had just died.
The deceased was laid out in the little cabin with
candles at his head and feet, and the usual number
of mourners around him. Now every one smokes
at a wake, and the visitor, lighted cigar in his
mouth, stood solemnly regarding the placid dead,
when some motion caused his cigar ash to fall
upon the placid face, whereupon the dead sneezed
and the wake broke up in "Konfusion." So at
least runs the tale.</p>

<p>An incident of the later afternoon is also attributed
to "a beast of a bird" which flew over our
heads shortly before its occurrence. It certainly
was a most amazing escape from a serious smash-up,
and only the steering ability of the chauffeur
saved us and the car. About to take a side road
running at right angles to the one we were on, and
hidden by a tall hedge, we came suddenly upon a
boy asleep in a cart drawn by an old white horse,
also apparently asleep. They were not twenty
feet off; to pass was impossible, and our man shot
his car forward, turned it almost on its axis and
under the nose of the old horse so closely that I
thought the shaft would strike me and dodged
down into the car; then another sharp turn down
into a ditch, fortunately grassy and not dangerously
deep, and up on to the road, and away as
though nothing had happened and all so quickly
done that the horse and boy stood stock still in
dumb amazement. It was a very close shave,
and proved that these cars can be turned completely
around in a much smaller space than one
would believe possible. We are not courting such
experiences, especially as news of the dreadful
deaths of the Trevor brothers in Cincinnati has
just been published. Our man is a superb driver
and thoroughly understands his machine; also
he does not lose his head for an instant, or on this
occasion it would have meant destruction all
round.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards a black sheep&mdash;"horror of
horrors," I heard B. exclaim&mdash;crossed our pathway
at tremendous speed, and having great
faith in the strength of its skull and in its butting
powers tried conclusions with a closed iron gateway,&mdash;the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
result being intense astonishment and
dire destruction to itself, the gate holding fast.
Earlier in the day we ran over for the first time a
goose, apparently without injury thereto, as the
last I saw it was chasing us down the road with
outstretched neck squawking loudly.</p>

<p>Our orders are strict as to avoiding all living
things if by so doing we do not endanger our own
safety and several times we have done so by sudden
swerves to save an old hen or chicken.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Taking it all together to-day's ride has not been
without excitement, and we almost decline to get
out when the car stops at Bannow House; but I
think the driver has had his fill of work for one
day, so it is ended, fortunately with no injury to
any one.</p>

<p>"To some men God hath given laughter, and
tears to some men he hath given."</p>

<p>To-day it is tears and sadness for one poor
woman.</p>

<p>B. is a magistrate here and last night at dinner
a warrant for his signature was brought to the
house. It was for the commitment of a poor
woman to an asylum for the insane and this
morning we roll away to the village to conclude
the matter. The "Court" awaits our arrival, but
I have no mind for such scenes; indeed I do not
think it right that mere lookers-on should be permitted,
any more than curiosity seekers should
be allowed to stare at men in prison. So I stay out
in the car while B., followed by the "Court," which
has been sunning itself outside, passes within.</p>

<p>However, I am not to escape in all ways, as,
turning my eyes towards a window to the left, I
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
see the poor woman staring out at me, the sadness
and misery of her expression passing description,&mdash;life
is so absolutely over for her, with nothing save
the horror of increasing insanity to look forward
to throughout all the years which may remain of
existence. Her mother died in an asylum and her
fate is certain. The curse of intermarriage has
pronounced her doom as it does for so many in
Ireland. It is also claimed that much of the
insanity so prevalent here is caused by excessive
use of tea, and <i>such</i> tea. Placed on the stove and
allowed to simmer and stew all day, it acquires a
strength that would destroy in time the strongest
of nerves.</p>

<p>This poor woman goes to the asylum by her
own wish, and is glad to go, knowing the hopelessness
of it all for her. Ah, the pity of it, and
one is so absolutely powerless to do aught to help!
The law is soon complied with and leaving her sad
face still at the window we roll away.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The day is especially brilliant and the air like
wine, laden with the fragrance of the hawthorn
and wild grasses; while the hedgerows bordering
the lanes are a mass of blossoms, and the world
is beautiful,&mdash;all the more beautiful by contrast
with that glimpse of sadness we have just left.</p>

<p>Our car goes rushing and singing along until we
round a bend of the road and are immediately involved
in wild confusion. An old lady&mdash;as usual&mdash;seated
on the smallest of carts, drawn by a most
diminutive donkey,&mdash;Ireland is full of old ladies
in carts, in fact one rarely sees any others in
them,&mdash;is vainly trying to stop the wild circles
it is describing, cart and all, in fright at our appearance.
It whirls her around at least a half-dozen
times before a passing postman seizing
the bridle leads it by us, while the ancient dame,
the flowers on her much awry bonnet trembling
with her indignation, hurls curses at us. "Blarst
yer sowls" comes back at us as she is borne away.</p>

<p>Truly sunshine and shadow, laughter and sadness
chase each other closely in this Isle of Erin.
Don't for a moment imagine, though you may
seem to be in the densest solitude of the country,
that there is nobody about; any instant a sudden
turn may find you in the midst of shrieking women,
flying chicks, quacking ducks, and scoffing geese,
where clatter and confusion and curses reign
supreme, but again those curses imply nothing
generally here, they are only a form of salutation,
and rarely mean what is said.</p>

<p>We pass down long stretches of road with the
sparkling sea spread out before us until we draw
up near the ruins of the seven churches of Clonmines,
close down by the placid waters of the
river.</p>

<p>Of the churches there is little left, save a few
ruined towers. In the centre of one where the
sunshine falls warmest and many flowers grow, the
late priest of the parish has found his resting-place.</p>

<p>After all there seems to have been close connection
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
between the far east and this Emerald
Isle. At these seven churches of Clonmines, there
was once held a Moorish slave market, and one
cannot but think that that keening for the dead
must have come from the chant which one may
still hear amongst the followers of the prophet.</p>

<p>Clonmines, which is named from the silver
mines near-by, was "a very ancient corporation
but quite ruinated" even in 1684 when we find
it so described in an old manuscript of Wexford.
In the time of the Danes it possessed a mint for
silver coining and was surrounded by a fosse.
On the shores of its river or tide inlet, called the
Pill, the descendants of the first English conquerors
still lived in the days of Elizabeth, in
fact we find yet living in one of these ancient
towers, the descendant of the man, Sir Roger de
Sutton, who built it <i>seven centuries ago</i>&mdash;a love of
home which passes understanding, for that abode
to-day could not be considered as agreeable under
any circumstances.</p>

<p>This little river was considered of such importance
in the days of Henry VI. that an act of
Parliament was passed for the building of towers
upon its banks "that none shall break the fortifications
or strength of the waters of Bannow."</p>

<p>Even in Henry IV.'s time one John Neville was
appointed keeper of this water, and the feudal
tenure by which the Hore family held their manor
of Pole was for the keeping of a passage over the
Pill when the Sessions were held at Wexford.
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>
But King and noble reckoned without the storms
of winter, which year after year drove the sands
of the sea inward, filling the harbour and finally
destroying all the towns on its banks. One of
them, Old Bannow, we have already visited, and
we leave this of Clonmines, to-day a ruin past all
redemption, inhabited by that one family whose
members have watched the years go by just here
for seven centuries.</p>

<p>As we glide off through the winding lanes, the
birds are talking to themselves in the hedgerows,
and could tell us much about it all I doubt not,
while far away on the soft air sounds the throbbing
and the sobbing of the sea.</p>

<p>Close by the roadside we come upon an evidence
of one of the quaint customs still to be met with
in this section. There is a certain tree&mdash;why so
selected does not appear&mdash;which is regarded as
holy, and every funeral which passes leaves a
small cross at its base, so that to-day the pile of
rude wooden emblems of our faith reaches half
way up its trunk. There are no shrines around
the place or any other evidence that it is regarded
as sacred or used as a point for devotion, simply
that mass of plain wooden crosses mounting high
around its trunk, and numbering many thousands,
each one representing the passing of some poor
soul out of this earthly sunshine and into the
shadow of the grave.</p>

<p>Our day is not over yet. This section of Ireland
so abounds in points of interest that fearing we
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>
may pass any of them the speed of the car is reduced
to that of a donkey-cart, in fact, several of
the latter pass us with great show of speed and
scornful glances cast by ancient dames at our
crawling monster, while the donkey kicks dust in
our faces&mdash;whether from contempt of us or a desire
to get home to supper he takes no time to state,
but the fact remains.</p>

<p>Our way leads down by the sea, and leaving the
car to puff itself to sleep, we pass through the
downs on the cliffs and out on to the point of
Baginbun. If you are not versed in Irish history,
you will wonder why you are brought here&mdash;it is
pretty, yes, certainly, but you have seen other places
far more so. There is a little cove just under you
where the waters murmur and whisper, but what
of that? Well, that is Baginbun and just there,
though time and tide have long since obliterated
the marks of their ships' prows, landed the English
for the first time in Ireland. Fitzstephens and
his band of adventurers in May, 1169, landed there
and doubtless climbed this hill where we stand
knee deep in the grass to day. What that meant
to Ireland is told in the history of all the ensuing
years down to this latter day. How many readers
are aware of the Bull of Pope Adrian IV. handing
Ireland body and soul over to Henry II. of England,&mdash;let
us quote a bit of it just here.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pmb3">"Adrian, Bishop, servant of the servants of God, to
our well beloved son in Christ, the illustrious King of
the English, health and apostolical benediction.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Your highness is contemplating the laudable and
profitable work of gaining a glorious fame on earth,
and augmenting the recompense of bliss that awaits
you in heaven, by turning your thoughts, in the proper
spirit of a Catholic Prince, to the object of widening
the boundaries of the Church, explaining the true
Christian faith to those ignorant and uncivilised
tribes, and exterminating the nurseries of vices from
the Lord's inheritance. In which matter, observing
as we do the maturity of deliberation and the soundness
of judgment exhibited in your mode of proceeding,
we cannot but hope that proportionate
success will, with the Divine permission, attend your
exertions.</p>

<p>"Certainly there is no doubt but that Ireland and
all the Islands upon which Christ, the Sun of Righteousness,
hath shined, and which have received
instruction in the Christian faith, do belong of right
to St. Peter and the Holy Roman Church, as your grace
also admits. For which reason we are the more
disposed to introduce into them a faithful plantation
and to engraft among them a stock acceptable in the
sight of God, in proportion as we are convinced from
conscientious motives that such efforts are made
incumbent on us by the urgent claims of duty.</p>

<p>"You have signified to us, son, well-beloved in
Christ, your desire to enter the island of Ireland in
order to bring that people into subjection to laws, and
to exterminate the nurseries of vices from the country;
and that you are willing to pay to St. Peter an annual
tribute of one penny for every house there, and to
preserve the ecclesiastical rights of that land uninjured
and inviolate. We, therefore, meeting your
pious and laudable desire with the favour which it

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>

deserves, and graciously according to your petition,
express our will and pleasure that, in order to widen
the bounds of the Church, to check the spread of vice,
to reform the state of morals and promote the inculcation
of virtuous dispositions, you shall enter
that island and execute therein what shall be for the
honour of God and the welfare of the country. And
let the people of that land receive you in honourable
style and respect you as their Lord. Provided always
that ecclesiastical rights be uninjured and inviolate,
and the annual payment of one penny for
every house be secured for St. Peter and the Holy
Roman Church.</p>

<p>"If then, you shall be minded to carry into execution
the plan which you have devised in your mind, use
your endeavour diligently to improve that nation
by the inculcation of good morals; and exert yourself,
both personally and by means of such agents as you
employ (whose faith, life, and conversation you shall
have found suitable for such an undertaking), that
the Church may be adorned there, that the religious
influence of the Christian faith may be planted and
grow there; and that all that pertains to the honour
of God and the salvation of souls may, by you, be
ordered in such a way as that you may be counted
worthy to obtain from God a higher degree of recompense
in eternity, and at the same time succeed in
gaining upon earth a name of glory throughout all
generations."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In such words this island, which had been
faithful to the Church of Rome for centuries, was
handed over by its head to bloodshed and murder.</p>

<p>That the progress of the King was watched and
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
approved of is amply set forth in the letter of
Pope Alexander III.:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Alexander, Bishop, servant of the servants of God,
to our well beloved son in Christ, Henry, the illustrious
King of the English, greeting and apostolical
benediction.</p>

<p>"It is not without very lively sensations of satisfaction
that we have learned, from the loud voice
of public report, as well as from the authentic statements
of particular individuals, of the expedition
which you have made in the true spirit of a pious
King and magnificent prince against that nation of
the Irish (who, in utter disregard of the fear of God,
are wandering with unbridled licentiousness into
every downward course of crime, and who have cast
away the restraints of the Christian religion and of
morality, and are destroying one another with mutual
slaughter), and of the magnificent and astonishing
triumph which you have gained over a realm into
which, as we are given to understand, the Princes of
Rome, the triumphant conquerors of the world, never,
in the days of their glory, pushed their arms, a success
to be attributed to the ordering of the Lord, by whose
guidance, as we undoubtedly do believe, your serene
highness was led to direct the power of your arms
against that uncivilised and lawless people."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There exists to-day the complaint of the Irish
Princes to Pope John XXII. in answer to a letter
from him to the Irish prelates empowering them
to launch the thunders of the Church against all,
whether lay or ecclesiastical, who were guilty of
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>
disaffection to the ruling powers. This from their
holy head in favour of the English was felt very
keenly all over the land and called forth the document
referred to above.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"In the name of Donald O'Neill, King of Ulster,
and rightful hereditary successor to the throne of all
Ireland, as well as Princes and Nobles of the same
realm with the Irish people in general present their
humble salutations approaching with kisses of devout
homage to his sacred feet."</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="pmb3">They lay before him, "with loud and imploring
cry," the treatment they have received, and also
an account of their descent from Milesius, the
<i>Spaniard</i>, through a line of one hundred and thirty-six
kings unto the time of St. Patrick, <span class="smcap">A.D.</span> 435.
From that saint's day until 1170 sixty-one kings
had ruled who acknowledged no superior, in things
temporal, and by whom the Irish Church was
endowed.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"'At length,' say the Princes, 'your predecessor,
Pope Adrian, an Englishman&mdash;although not so completely
in his origin as in his feelings and connections,&mdash;in
the year of our Lord 1155, upon the representation,
false and full of iniquity, which was made to him
by Henry, King of England&mdash;the monarch under
whom, and perhaps at whose instigation, St. Thomas,
of Canterbury, in the same year, suffered death, as you
are aware, in defence of Justice and of the Church,&mdash;made
over the dominion of this realm of ours in a certain
set form of words to that Prince, whom, for the
crime here mentioned, he ought rather to have been deprived
of his own kingdom; presenting him <i>de facto</i>
with what he had no right to bestow, while the question
touching the justice of the proceeding was utterly
disregarded, Anglican prejudices, lamentable to say,
blinding the vision of that eminent Pontiff. And
thus despoiling us of our royal honour, without any
offence of ours, he handed us over to be lacerated by
teeth more cruel than those of any wild beasts. For,
ever since the time when the English, upon occasion
of the grant aforesaid, and under the mask of a sort
of outward sanctity and religion, made their unprincipled
aggression upon the territories of our realm,
they have been endeavouring, with all their might,
and with every art which perfidy could employ,
completely to exterminate, and utterly to eradicate
our people from the country ... and have compelled
us to repair, in the hope of saving our lives, to
mountainous, woody and swampy and barren spots,
and to the caves of the rocks also, and in these, like
beasts, to take up our dwelling for a length of time.'</p>

<p>"The Princes enclosed a copy of Pope Adrian's Bull,
along with their Complaint, to Pope John, which
Bull the latter Pope forwarded to King Edward....</p>

<p>"The part which the <i>Church of Rome</i> has taken, not
only in the bringing of <i>Ireland</i> under <i>English rule</i> in
the first instance, but in the <i>maintenance</i> of that rule,
has <i>never been understood by the Irish people in general</i>.</p>

<p>"Dr. Lanigan, whose history of Ireland is expensive
and scarce, says of Pope Adrian that 'love of his
country, his wish to gratify Henry, and some other
not very becoming reasons, prevailed over every
other consideration, and the condescending Pope,

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>

with great cheerfulness and alacrity, took upon himself
to make over to Henry all Ireland, and got a letter,
or Bull, drawn up to that effect and directed to him,
in which, among other queer things, he wishes him
success in his undertaking, and expresses the hope
that it will conduce, not only to his glory in this world,
but likewise to his eternal happiness in the next.'<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>"Adrian's old master was one Marianus, an Irishman,
for whom he had great regard, yet, says Dr.
Lanigan, 'he was concerned in hatching a plot against
that good man's country, and in laying the foundation
of the destruction of the independence of Ireland.'<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p>"This is strong language from an Irish Roman
Catholic clergyman, who enjoys the fullest confidence
of his country, with regard to a former Pope, and it
must be remembered that the statement was not
made in a platform speech, when momentary excitement
might impel a speaker into the use of words
which he would afterwards regret, but that it was
calmly and deliberately penned in the quietness of
the study, and, probably, read and re-read, and
finally corrected, before it was committed to print.</p>

<p>"The Rev. M.J. Brennan, O. S. F., who is not at all
so unprejudiced as Dr. Lanigan, states that 'Adrian,
anxious for the aggrandisement of his country,'
or, as Cardinal Pole expresses it, 'induced by the love
of his country, lost no time in complying with the
agent's request.'<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> The agent referred to was John
of Salisbury, who had been sent by King Henry in 1155
to ask for the Pope's sanction for the invasion of
Ireland, and who states that the invasion was delayed

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>

until 1171 by the restraining influence of the King's
mother, the Empress Matilda. With this statement
Dr. Lanigan agrees.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>"It is a mistake to suppose that the Conquest of
Ireland is due to the appeal made in 1168 by Dermot
MacMurrogh for King Henry's aid. That event
merely afforded to the King and the Pope a convenient
excuse for carrying out a long-determined
plan.</p>

<p>"Attempts have been made on various grounds to
justify Pope Adrian's action. Edmund Campion,
the famous English Jesuit, alleges that the Spanish
ancestors of the Irish were subject '376 years ere
Christ was born' to one Gurguntius, from whom
King Henry was descended, and that, consequently,
the Pope only helped to restore to Henry his rightful
authority.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> But this notion is too far-fetched to
deserve consideration.</p>

<p>"A more plausible excuse is that about a century
previous to the Conquest the Irish handed over to the
Pope of that time&mdash;Urban II.&mdash;the sovereignty of
this country. This theory was advocated by the
Rev. Geoffrey Keatinge, D.D.</p>

<p>"But a still more popular excuse is, that all the
Christian Islands of the Ocean were conferred on the
Popes by the first Christian Emperor, Constantine.

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>

"Dr. Lanigan brushes aside all these fanciful ideas
with one sweep. 'This nonsense' he says, 'of the Pope's
being the head owner of all Christian Islands had been
partially announced to the world in a Bull of Urban
II., dated 1091, in which, on disposing of the Island
of Corsica, he said that the Emperor Constantine had
given the Islands to St. Peter and his vicars. But
Constantine could not give what did not belong to him,
and accordingly, as Keatinge argues, could not have
transferred the sovereignty of Ireland to any Pope.'<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>"As to Keatinge's own idea, namely, that the Irish
had transferred their crown to the Pope, Dr. Lanigan
writes: 'Neither in any of the Irish annals, nor in
the ecclesiastical documents of those times, whether
Roman or Irish, is there a trace to be found of a
transfer of Ireland to Urban II., or to any Pope, by
either the Irish Kings or Irish nobility, although
the sly Italian, Polydore Virgil, who has been followed
by two Englishmen, Campion and Sanders (both
Jesuits), and also by some Irish writers, has told some
big lies on this subject. These stories were patched
up in spite of Chronology, or of any authority whatsoever,
and Keatinge swallowed them as he did many
others.'"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p class="pmb3">There is much more to be read on the subject
and those who are interested in the question cannot
do better than examine that very excellent
little work of John Roche Ardill, <i>Forgotten Facts
of Irish History</i>,<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> from which the foregoing pages

<p>A very recent writer (Thomas Addis Emmet)
states that</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It would be inconsistent with the truth were
we to attribute the piteous condition of Ireland
to any other cause than that the great majority
of the Irish people belong to the Catholic faith.
Had the Irish been willing to cast aside, for temporal
benefit, the faith which they have unflinchingly
maintained for over twelve centuries, their country
would have received every aid to advance prosperity,
which would, with their greater advantages of soil
and climate, have been far greater than that attained
by Scotland."<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>What has Mr. Emmet to say of the treatment
of the Irish people by the English <i>Romanists</i>
from Henry II. down to and including the
reign of Mary the First? He will scarcely find
that the students of Irish history will agree
with his statement.</p>

<p>There is another tale, legend or fact, in
which, of course, a woman and her abduction
from her husband, O'Roirke, Prince of Breffin,
by Dermot MacMurrogh, King of Leinster, with
her own consent many think, was the cause of the
interposition of the English, and she is called the
Irish Helen. Dermot fled to England and laid
his case before the King, craving protection and
swearing allegiance. Henry was too busily engaged
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
in France to attend, but he did issue an
edict offering his protection to all who might aid
his trusted <i>subject</i>, Dermot, King of Leinster.</p>

<p>This aroused Richard, Earl of Chepstow, called
"Strongbow," who for his assistance was to
receive the hand of Dermot's daughter in marriage,
and a settlement of all of that Irish King's
property upon them and their children (a contract
which was fulfilled), but Strongbow being
tardy was anticipated by Robert Fitzstephens,
who agreed to assist Dermot, and was to receive
in payment the town of Wexford and adjoining
lands, and he it was whose boats landed on this
little beach, where the water murmurs so quietly
to-night.</p>

<p>Dermot in his castle yonder at Ferns awaited the
coming of these invaders, and promptly sent his
natural son Donald with five hundred horse to
join them, and so the game was played, and his
throne restored to him.</p>

<p>Then came Strongbow, then Henry II. with
his armies, and the English were here to stay.</p>

<p>Whatever the facts of the case are, it is certain
that just here landed the first of the English, and
from here spread their rule,&mdash;whether for good or
ill is the great question of to-day in this island.
There are no relics of the event, though there
appear to be some earthworks which are thought
of Celtic origin.</p>

<p>The leagues are not many which separate this
cliff from Cardiganshire in Wales, and a friendly
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
intercourse was kept up until Pope and King came
together in solemn conclave.</p>

<p>One of that King's first acts was the bestowal
of Dublin upon the "good citizens of my town
of Bristol." The capital of a kingdom bestowed
upon the <i>traders</i> of Bristol! The original of this
gift is in the Record Office of Dublin castle.</p>

<p class="pmb2">Would it have been any satisfaction to those
of the land which he had so oppressed to have
known of the ending of this "Great King"?
Dying at Chinon in a rage so terrible that even
death could not smooth out the traces from his
face, Henry II.'s body was plundered like the
Conqueror's, and, like his, left stark naked.
Shrouded at last in some cast-off garments, it was
placed in its coffin, a rust-broken sceptre stuck
in its hand, an old and meaningless ring of no
value on its finger, while the crown on its brow was
composed of a piece of gold fringe torn from a
discarded robe of some court dame, who doubtless
had curtsied to the ground many times before the
living monarch. In such state, Henry II. was
buried in the stately abbey of Fontevrault and
promptly forgotten, though the wrongs he did
Ireland lived on and on.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Ireland has seen strange wild times, and no
section of it more than this remote County
Wexford. As I have stated, this estate of
Bannow is eighteen miles from a railroad station
now, but in another month a new line three miles
away opens for traffic, and though a good thing
for the property of all in the county, it will sound
the knell of probably all the quaint and curious
customs still in vogue here. If that railway company
is wise it will build a seaside hotel in this
neighbourhood. The climate is for most of the
year delightful and is rarely subject to the howling
tempests which so constantly sweep the west
coast for half the year. Wexford abounds in
beautiful scenery and almost every valley holds
a charming home while quaint towns crowd the
river banks and ruined towers crown the hills
on either side.</p>

<p>The maintenance of many of these Irish estates
becomes each year more and more difficult unless
the whole is strictly entailed. This is especially
the case with places of small income, say two or
three thousand pounds sterling. In the days when
rents were good and five per cent. obtained it was
well enough, but to-day when three per cent. is all
that can be hoped for and yet the old charges for
dowers and legacies must be paid, the owner is
perforce a poor man. At present the landlord
seems to have no rights. His tenants may and
do absolutely refuse to pay him rent and he is
reduced to poverty. There is a case I know of
where the tenants are amply able to pay him,
but they simply <i>won't</i>. His only resource is
eviction, which is slow, expensive, and brings down
wrath upon his head. So he is forced to give
up his home and retire to a cottage, while his
tenants laugh at him.</p>

<p>In the case of the peasants, eviction is not only
expensive but useless. No man will rent the hut
of those turned out, no matter how many years
drift by, and some landlords are reinstating their
evicted tenants. Better them than empty farms.</p>

<p>With the new Land Act the tenants dictate
that they will buy or nothing. Of course there
have arisen the usual number of scoundrels who
get behind these peasants, buy out their rights,
and in the end get the land for a song. There are
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span>
several instances where such men who at one time
broke stones on the highway are now landowners
of considerable extent. I heard of one the other
day who was just adding a billiard-room to his
"mansion."</p>

<p>There is much said over here about the corruption
of our city governments, especially those of
Chicago and New York, but I also hear that that
of the city of Dublin is to say the very least
nothing to boast of, and that graft has even penetrated
London itself.</p>

<p>Home rule for the peasants of Ireland, so it is
stated here, would be about as sensible as a rule
of the blacks in America. When the leaders
in Parliament found they could make no more
money by the disturbances, they called them
off, and one of the members of that august body
was kicked all the way down this peaceful avenue
before me here and out yonder gate for abuse of
the late Queen.</p>

<p>During the boycott, Bannow House was in a
state of siege and its owner forced to start a store
on the lawn for his own workmen, who could not
purchase anywhere. These provisions were
brought from London under guard.</p>

<p>After his death&mdash;in 1881&mdash;his grave, guarded
by policemen for twenty-four hours&mdash;until the
concrete in which his coffin had been buried had
set,&mdash;was surrounded all the time by a howling
mob who would have promptly "had him out"
otherwise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span></p>

<p>He hated the parson and so left the church's
legacy of two thousand pounds to the "next incumbent,"
or rather the interest thereof, but the
parson was equal to the occasion, and, resigning,
got himself re-elected, and so became the "next
incumbent" and secured the interest.</p>

<p>There was another instance here where the holy
man, this time a priest, did not fare so well. He
had attacked a member of his parish from the
pulpit, and thereby aroused the ire of the wife.
She was about six feet tall, and following the
priest into the vestry-room flogged him soundly.
It was a foolish thing to do, as it roused the whole
country round about and she and her household
almost starved from the boycott which promptly
followed. On her death it was necessary to bury
her also in cement, to prevent desecration, every
man at the funeral carrying a gun.</p>

<p>Fortunately those days are gone by, let us hope
for all time, but with a people so ignorant and
superstitious anything may happen and if that
cattle driving does not cease old times will come
again.</p>

<p>It is quiet enough here this morning; the peace
of the country is intense, yet to me it is never a
solitude, never lonely, and it is delicious to awake
in the early light and feel the cool, damp air blow
in upon one through the open window, while even
at this hour of dawn yonder old reprobate of a
wood pigeon is earnestly entreating Paddy to
follow the way of the transgressor,&mdash;"<i>two</i> coos,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
Paddy," "two coos." One can almost hear the
stealthy rustle of the departing beasts and the
soft footfall of Paddy. Far beyond the trees
where the pigeons hide, the fair blue of heaven
has been rain-washed during the night, and white
clouds drift lazily off towards the sea murmuring
in the distance.</p>

<p>To-day brings my stay at Bannow House to a
close, I trust not for all time. After luncheon,
bidding our hostess farewell, we roll away through
the avenue of rhododendrons, over the meadows,
through the forest, where the insistent birds try
for the last time to corrupt my honesty, and so
out on the highway and off to the north.</p>

<p>Our route takes us past the site of Scullaboyne
House, a spot sadly famous.</p>

<p class="pmb3">In the dark days of the rebellion of 1798, New
Ross and this vicinity of Bannow suffered horribly.
Indeed the battle at the former town was the most
sanguinary of that period, and an event which
followed it here too horrible to be passed
over without notice even at this late date.
Scullaboyne House, but lately deserted by its
owner, Capt. King, and seized by the rebels, was
in use as a prison. In the house itself were confined
some thirty-seven men and women and
in the adjoining barn were over one hundred
men, women, and children, chiefly, but not exclusively,
Protestants. After their defeat at
New Ross the rebels sent word to destroy these
prisoners. Those in the house were called one
by one to the door and shot down, but a worse
fate awaited those in the barn, where firebrands
thrown into and upon its roof soon turned the
whole into a red hot furnace. Children were
tossed out of the windows to save them, but
only to be impaled upon the pikes of the outlaws.
Some authorities claim that two hundred and
thirty persons met their deaths in Scullaboyne.
Certainly the French Revolution can show nothing
more horrible.</p>

<p>There is little left here now to recall the event
save a few blackened fragments, which the rich
grass and creeping vines are daily covering more
and more each passing year.</p>

<p>It is claimed by the insurgent party that they
had nothing to do with the slaughter&mdash;that it
was the act of outlaws, such as are always to be
found dogging the footsteps of contending forces.
However that may be, the result was absolute
ruin to the cause of the rebels. Be it recorded
to the credit of the intelligent priests of the day
that they at all times did what they could to
prevent like occurrences and save human life
and that amongst the sixty-six persons executed
in Wexford, after that period, for murder and
rebellion, only one was a priest.</p>

<p>But let us hasten away from all this.</p>

<p>The roadways are superb all over this section
of Ireland, and indeed I have so far encountered
none which could be called bad the (worst were
better than we have around most of our cities),
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
and we are at the extreme south, having circled
the island.</p>

<p>To-day we meet but few motors. Others are
not so fortunate, as we discover by a disturbed
roadbed and some fragments of cars lying around.</p>

<p>The other day, Lord Blank and a friend of his,
driving their cars here on roads running at right
angles and shaded by tall hedges,&mdash;the noise of
each motor drowned in that of the other,&mdash;came
together, "sociable like," at the junction. Result,
two cars gone to smash, but bless you that's "all
in a lifetime" in this blessed isle.</p>

<p>Bicyclists also appear to meet with trouble
now and then, as we have just passed an inn
bearing the sign "Broken down cyclists rest free."</p>

<p>The road from Bannow via New Ross to Kilkenny
passes through Inistiogey, Thomastown,
and Bennett's Bridge, and is fine all the way and
through lovely scenery, most of the time by the
banks of the Barrow.</p>

<p>We reach Kilkenny about three <span class="smcap">P. M.</span>, two
hours and five minutes out, about fifty miles,
which is good time on Irish routes, because of
their narrowness and the frequent stoppages
rendered necessary through stubborn donkeys and
young cattle.</p>

<p>The approach to Kilkenny is marked, as is most
appropriate, by an increase in the number of cats,
sorry looking specimens, most of them. I must
congratulate the town upon her very clean and
comfortable Club Hotel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>Kilkenny Castle is not of interest save its stately
appearance from the bridge. It has been modernised
into a comfortable dwelling-place, prosaic in
the extreme.</p>

<p>I find in Ireland that the interesting abodes
are of two classes only, the very ancient castle or
the square manor-house; the latter, while appearing
modern, have some centuries to their
credit and are characteristic of the country. I
certainly have never seen them elsewhere. Castles
such as Kilkenny and Lismore (the Duke of
Devonshire's), while holding somewhere in their
vastness remnants of the ancient strongholds,
have, as I have stated, been brought up to date
and out of all interest.</p>

<p>The same holds with the cathedral here. Even
the round tower looks new. Rolling onward we
pass again through the Vale of Ovoca, but have
no time now for more than a glance as the day
wanes and rain threatens.</p>

<p>Entering amongst the mountains of Wicklow,
our car balks once or twice at the grades, but
finally makes up its mind to go ahead and so puffs
and pulls and stews with less noise than most
motors would be guilty of, until finally, with a
last effort, the highest point is reached, and the
vale beyond is open to our view, with the demesne
of Powerscourt nestling on its farther side. There
are few more enchanting prospects in the British
Isles. It would seem from here to be a great bowl,
so completely enclosed in the mountains as to be
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
accessible only by wings. The billowy foliage is
broken at one point by a waterfall some three
hundred feet high, which plunges down into the
celebrated glen, "the Dargle."</p>

<p>Half-way up the mountain stands the huge
mansion of Powerscourt House, as though it were
the royal box in this vast opera-house of nature.
Dublin has many beautiful points in her neighbourhood,
more in fact I think than any other city
of Europe, but none so beautiful as this before us.</p>

<p>The temptation to linger is strong, but it is
late, and there are miles yet to go. The route
drops rapidly downward and then upward until
barred by the gates of the home park, which we
are allowed to enter once it is certain that we are
"going to the house" and are not tourists.</p>

<p>When we reach there every one is abroad in
motors, and it is too late for tea, but not too late
for a whiskey and soda, which, being assured that
we are expected,&mdash;hosts have been known to forget
their invitations,&mdash;is accepted and thoroughly
enjoyed.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Powerscourt, the seat of Viscount Powerscourt
came into possession of the family during the
reign of Elizabeth, and is one of the largest estates
in Ireland, having some twenty-six thousand
acres within its bounds. Probably its scenery is
more varied and beautiful than that of any other
estate in the kingdom.</p>

<p>One enters a hallway of large dimensions, whose
walls and ceilings are laden with trophies of the
chase from all over the world. Skins of every
description cover walls and floors, while chandeliers
formed of antlers hang by the dozens from the
ceilings.</p>

<p>Doffing our coats and rugs on its great table
and trying to appear like white men after our
hundred-mile run through rain and mud, we pass
into the morning room and so out on to the terrace
beyond, which on this side of the house stretches
along the entire front, while below terrace after
terrace drops downward to a stone balustrade
overlooking the lake, beyond which the land rises
tier after tier until the higher mountains outline
against the sky.</p>

<p>The rain has ceased and the setting sun is casting
long shafts of light into the quivering
forests whose leaves are thicker than ever they
were in Vallombrosa.</p>

<p>But it is chilly and we hunt out the smoking-room
where a bright fire works its will with the
winds driven through us all day and we are found
half asleep when host and hostess return.</p>

<p>These Irish places are not so gorgeous as many
in England but an Irish welcome is something one
does not meet with either in England or any other
land, and to-day holds no exception to that rule.
They are glad to see us and the usual stiffness of
an entry in a strange house and amongst strange
people is altogether lacking. The time passes so
quickly that the dressing gong sounds all too soon.</p>

<p>As I mount the stair portraits of the former
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>
owners look down upon me, from those long dead
to that of the present owner, presented by his
tenants upon his coming of age, which by the way
must have occurred very lately, as he is the
youngest looking man to be the father of two
children that I have ever seen.</p>

<p>There is another portrait in yonder corner of a
man who looks as though <i>he</i> would like a whiskey
and soda on this damp evening, but he must long
since have passed to the land where such things
are not.</p>

<p>At the head of this main stairway, one enters
a vast hall supported by columns. George the
Fourth strutted through here in all his gorgeousness
in 1821. As far as Royalty is concerned, that
monarch and his successor certainly marked its
lowest stage&mdash;the latter the worse of the two, as he
was common. The rebound since then has been
so tremendous that one feels as though gazing
from the top of a mountain downward upon the
marshes by the sea.</p>

<p>One of the late owners of Powerscourt evidently
felt great interest in the house as he placed
tablets in many of the rooms indicating what they
were and had been. I am told to go where I like
and examine the whole, but of course I do not
penetrate behind closed doors where evidently
there is much of interest. But I do get lost
actually as far as the body is concerned and
mentally in a picture of a lady in the dark corner
of a distant gallery, and have to be hunted out
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
when the gong sounds for dinner. In the dining-room
my eye is attracted by a portrait on the
opposite wall. It proves to be one of Lady Jane
Grey when a child of eight or nine years of age,
but has a very Dutch appearance and the original
could never have developed into the graceful greyhound-like
creature so familiar to all in the later
portraits.</p>

<p>The living-rooms in these European country
houses are so homelike and comfortable that similar
rooms in our Newport houses must strike a foreigner
as very stiff and new, and generally they are just
that, for with few exceptions they are but temporary
abiding-places for a few weeks in summer.</p>

<p>The drawing-room in Powerscourt is a wide,
sunny apartment; in the daytime its windows,
giving on to the terrace, hold a marvellous panorama
framed for one's benefit, but to-night the
curtains are dropped and a bright fire blazes on
the hearth around which runs a rail topped with
a broad leather cushion, which forms a most comfortable
perch promptly appropriated by the men,
while the ladies are on low seats.</p>

<p>The walls are covered by pictures of great value
and there is much else of interest around one, yet
it is all so homelike and comfortable that one
scarcely remembers any of the details but simply
a charming picture of the whole; and so the time
passes until the ladies having vanished we are
again in the smoking-room, where Boyse starts in
to talk and would have kept it up until grey dawn,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
but I for one am sleepy and detect the same symptoms
in our host, so we suppress Boyse and go to
bed. He may talk to the fire if he likes, but not
to us.</p>

<p>The next day being Sunday I wanted to go
to church, but it is intimated that my presence
is not desired. So Boyse and I roll off to
Dublin for letters and en route back break down
and nearly miss luncheon in consequence.</p>

<p class="pmb3">On our return we encountered one of the rare
cases of hatred, pure and simple, for those of the
upper ranks which I have noted in Ireland. The
avenues between Bray and the city were crowded
with Sunday excursionists, and at one point, a
van having stopped, the occupants covered all the
roadway and two men stood facing us exactly in the
centre of our only course. Moving at a snail's
pace, we trumpeted constantly and finally stopped
directly in front of these men. I have never
noted more malignant snarls on human countenances
than these bore as they grudgingly gave
way. "Do ye think ye own the whole shop?"
The fact that we appeared unconscious of their
existence only enraged them the more, and had
they dared strike they would have done so, but
one is always sure of the presence of some of those
splendid specimens of men, the Irish constabulary,
than whom the world holds of their kind none
better. All over six feet in stature, they are not
merely policemen, ignorant or not as the case may
be, but men of education and who must keep up
that education by further study for higher examinations,
which unpassed will cost them their
positions. There are three here to-day, hence
those lowering brows and clenched hands disappear.
However, we have encountered but little
of that state of feeling in Ireland, the instances
have been few and far between,&mdash;a contrast indeed
to France, where a well-dressed man is often impressed
with the belief that those around him
would like to erect a guillotine for his express
enjoyment and would do so upon the smallest
provocation.</p>

<p>All the afternoon is spent out of doors. Other
guests have arrived, one with three motors and
another with one. Lord P. has several and ours
has been polished up to look its best, but we
finally leave it behind, and stowed away in the
others the whole cavalcades spend the afternoon
in wild flights over the hills and mountains.
In the rushes through the valleys we are well
together, but in climbing the ascents which
around here are very steep the cars of greater
power vanish in the distance and we do not see
them again and only know of their passage by the
general state of wild confusion reigning amongst
dogs, geese, and chickens, which knowing there
must be more of us have not as yet returned to
the centre of the highways; except the geese&mdash;it
takes more than a motor to keep those doughty
birds off the road.</p>

<p>Those are wonderful fowls. They measure the
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
width of an approaching car to a nicety, and
retreat just beyond that. So near in fact that
we have been struck by their indignant wings
several times.</p>

<p>To-day I am in an enclosed car belonging to
Mr. G. Whilst very comfortable, especially for
ladies in a city, I do not think that they are
pleasant to ride in. The constant rumble and
roar becomes very unpleasant, something one
never experiences in an open car; also one loses
entirely that sensation of flying so delicious in an
open car. This one makes my head ache, and it
is not a matter of regret when, the ride over, I
am out on the lake with Lord H., attempting to
tug a duck house out of the mud. I am quite
convinced that I did most of the work, but I
believe he denies that fact.</p>

<p>I cannot but regret as I look at this young man,
certainly not more than twenty-five years of age,
that we have not something like a school for the
study of diplomacy. We might even have such
scholarships, now that we have decided to become
a world power in which diplomats are so necessary.
I asked what was the future of this man in question
and was told, "Oh, he will be an ambassador some
day, that is what he is working for," and working
for that means the attainment of perfection in
all things necessary for an educated man,&mdash;perfection
in everything, not a mere smattering in
a few things. This man speaks all the modern
languages of Europe with equal facility. If music
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>
is necessary for his career he has it at his fingers'
ends. He is wealthy, but his money will be used
to further his progress, not to kill it. Nothing
will interfere with that.</p>

<p>I cannot but contrast him with one I know
of whose prospects appeared equally bright,
though his education was not at all the equal of
this man's. However, he might have done much
with his life, but marrying a rich wife he promptly
resigned and "sat down to good dinners," amounting
now to absolutely nothing, his career ended.</p>

<p>Abandoning the rescue of the duck house together
with graver questions, we adjourn to the gardens
and consume half an hour, and also a lot of the
biggest strawberries I have ever eaten.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Time flies. Tea on the terrace, to which more
motors have brought other guests, dinner, and the
night are over and gone, and we have rolled away,
waving thanks to our host and hostess for the
pleasant "week end" at Powerscourt House.</p>

you should go elsewhere. All Dublin is in an

motors of all descriptions pass like the wind. The
beggars are out in full force and if you have a

with not a shilling left you. Our motor dashes
around the corner and up to the door as though
it were new instead of some years of age. The

<p>Of the thousands who come this way to-day, few
give thought to the house or its history. They
have little time for the past as just a few miles
beyond is the famous Curragh of Kildare, a stretch
of the most marvellous grass-lands in the world,
where the turf is of greatest richness and elasticity.
Not for this, and yet because of this, the people
flock four times a year in tens of thousands to
worship there at the altar of the noble horse. The
Curragh holds Ireland's greatest race-course, and
has held it for two thousand years. The winner
of the last English Derby is to be on hand and to
race to-day and nearly all Ireland is en route to
be present.</p>

<p>So there is no time for dead Earls and ruined
houses on such a day, and we are swept on and
away, for once forgetting our caution and bidding
the chauffeur beat every other motor on the road
if he can, and to our amazement this old "Clement"
comes near to doing it, and there are some very
smart cars going down to-day. How the wind does
sing around us&mdash;if a cap is lost we do not stop to
get it&mdash;it would not be possible or safe to do so
with this onrushing crowd behind us. Dogs and
chickens get out of the way in wildest terror, and
it seems to me that we take several turns on two
wheels only. It is dangerous work and we know
that a break means destruction most complete,
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
but we cannot help it. Curragh air had gotten
into our heads and go we must.</p>

<p>After all is said, I think the desire for a race is
in every man of us, inborn and irresistible. Such
is the case to-day and our record is good, though
every now and then a sullen rumble and roar and
many blasts of a horn warn us that some car of
great power is coming to which we must give
place, and though going at full speed we seem to
stand still as it rushes by us, and here comes in
one of the greatest dangers of the road. The
clouds of dust in the wake of such a car are appalling
and impenetrable to sight, yet through this
our own car rushes on, trusting to Providence to
keep the way clear. It is a relief to me at least
when it mounts in safety to the downy stretches
of the Curragh where there is no dust, and I find
on calling the roll that none of our party is missing.</p>

<p>What a beautiful sight! The downs of deep
grass stretch away on all sides crossed and recrossed
by the wide highways. Off to the left
lies the great military camp, while in front
stretches the race-course, towards which what
seems the whole of Dublin is moving and in every
imaginable manner, from the foot passenger and
funny little donkey to the tally-ho coaches and
the gorgeous motor-cars, while over and around it
all rings the Irish laughter, as it has rung around
this race-course of Curragh for two thousand
years,&mdash;its very name "<i>Cuir reach</i>" implying
"race-course." It must mean that to-day at all
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
events, but I should think that if any sort of a
race could disappoint an Irishman that to-day, the
Irish Derby, would do so. It was a foregone conclusion
that the winner of that race in England
would be first here,&mdash;but to my thinking it proves
no race at all, that horse and another of the
same owner simply running round the course with
no show for any other, and with apparently no
speed exerted on their own parts.</p>

<p>However, it is the changing panorama of the
people and not the race which interests me, and
that is not in any degree a disappointment.</p>

<p>The return to Dublin and on to Bray was the
same wild flight as when going down and a feeling
of relief came to me at least when we got safely
back to our hotel, or rather to the exposition
grounds where we dined. What time we reach
the hotel and bed I have no memory. Boyse
never got there at all.</p>

<p>The following day being rainy, I am not disposed
to go to the races, and also learn that our car is in
need of attention. However, another must be
forthcoming if desired, and one does come, in
which Boyse and a friend of his, "Copper," are
most comfortably packed, and evidently bound for
the Curragh, being Irish. Now, though that is my
car, my absence is evidently very precious to its
occupants; still Boyse <i>does</i> ask kindly whether I
"would like to go." What a pressing invitation
that!&mdash;much like a blast from the North Atlantic.
For an instant I am tempted to say yes, just to
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
watch their discomfort, but I much prefer not
to go and so state, when&mdash;whiz&mdash;they vanish
like smoke around the corner, evidently with no
intention of allowing any reconsideration on my
part.</p>

<p>Laughing, I summon a jaunting-car and go to
buy my ticket homeward. The usual tariff for
short distances is a sixpence and I hand it over
on descending at the ticket office. The driver evidently
has exposition extortions in his head for,
regarding me sourly for an instant, he remarks,
"Ye could 'ave saved five ov thim if ye'd come in
the tram." However, his anger is short lived,
and when I laugh he laughs. God bless you, Pat,&mdash;may
you succeed in "doing" the next man you
carry.</p>

<p class="pmb3">Many of our evenings have been passed at the
Kildare Street Club, of which Boyse is a member.
While they do not give a stranger a week's card
as we do, a member seems to be at liberty to take
him there as often as that member desires, and so
the result is the same, if not better. Certainly
at this, the best club in the Irish capital, I was
made to feel as much at home as in my own in
America. I shall always remember it and the
men I met there with pleasure.</p>

<p>There are clubs in London, notably the Army
and Navy, where one is treated in the same
manner. That club has been growing more and
more liberal of late years. At one period a short
while ago, a stranger could go only to one room
and one dining-room. Now in company with a
member the whole club is open to him. There
are other London clubs where he may not even
pass the portals, but this is the twentieth century,
an age of reform, and all that will change in time.
What homelike and yet what heartless things
clubs are! A man may make his home in one for
years, may have his own particular corner and be
the very life and soul of the house; many would
declare that the place could not get on without
his jests and merry laugh, and that they would
miss him for ever. How many would do so?
Coming in some day they would note the flag at
half mast and his name on a black bordered card
near the door. Most who passed would not be
able to recall his features whilst remembering that
they had drank with him often, and the majority
would forget him promptly. For those who did
remember, it would be sad to think that</p>

<p>The touring is almost over, and I fancy for
ever, in Ireland. Our last day's journey was one
of the most pleasant and interesting of the lot.
Having gone to Bray Head to escape the heat
of the city, we rolled off at nine a.m. and passing
through town in a rush fled southwards towards
the military camp at Curragh. The day was
brilliant and the motor fairly flew over the highway
which to-day we have all to ourselves.</p>

<p>Passing again the unfinished palace of the Earl
of Stratford we paused to inspect it and to learn
its history.</p>

<p>"Jigginstown" was built by Sir Thomas Wentworth,
created Earl of Stratford by Charles I.,
who made him Deputy of Ireland and regarded
him at the time as his chief minister and counsellor.
In his early years he was certainly a
character of doubtful virtue, as before this appointment
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
he was as strongly counter to the King as he
was for him after he had received it. The King
was subject to a violent outcry for using a Papist
to murder his subjects. Wentworth laboured under
the severe hatred of the English, Scotch, and Irish.
He secured from the Irish Parliament large sums
which he used to engage an army against Scotland.
His rule here lasted eight years, and while
active and prudent he was most unpopular.
When his fall occurred the Irish Parliament used
every expedient to aggravate the charge against
him. Envy and jealousy both here and in England
were the prime causes of his ruin.</p>

<p>Knowing the power and deadly hatred of his
enemies he implored the King to excuse him from
attending Parliament, but Charles promised that
not a hair of his head should be injured; but his
enemies arose in such might, that no voice was
raised in his defence and he was accused of high
treason. The whole affair was a gigantic conspiracy
of the leaders of the Parliament against
one man, of whom they could prove no wrong
save that he served the King, and who they were
well aware possessed knowledge of their own
treason. "Unprotected by power, without counsel,
discountenanced by authority, what hope had he?
yet such was the capacity, genius, and presence of
mind displayed by this magnanimous statesman
that while argument, reason, and law held any
place he obtained the victory and he perished by
the open violence of his enemies."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span></p>

<p>(There is a strong resemblance between this
trial and that of the Queen of Scots in Fotheringay
the preceding century.) His government of
Ireland was promotive of the King's interests and
of the people commended to his charge. He introduced
industries and the arts of peace and augmented
the shipping of the kingdom a hundred
fold. The customs were tripled upon the same
rates, the exports doubled in value that of the imports,
and he introduced the manufacture of
linen;&mdash;that stands his monument to-day, but,&mdash;he
was a friend of the King and so must die.</p>

<p>That is one side of the picture. His enemies
claim that whether guilty of the crime named
at the trial or not, he deserved death for his
treatment of the Irish. They state that his project
was to subvert the titles to every estate in Connaught,
also that he had sent Lord Ely to prison
to force him (Ely) to settle his estates according
to the wishes of his daughter-in-law, whom
Strafford had seduced. The House, on his condemnation,
nobly excluded his children from the
legal consequences of his sentence.</p>

<p class="pmb3">It is stated that the King was deeply grieved
but he certainly did consent to the deed, though
by appointing a commission of four noblemen to
give the royal assent in his name, he flattered
himself that neither his will consented to the deed
nor his hand engaged in it. The exclamation of
the doomed man, "Put not your trust in princes,"
told how he felt, and so he died in his forty-ninth
year, one of the most eminent personages that has
appeared in English history.</p>

<p>His great unfinished palace rears its walls now
close by the highway and of all the thousands who
rush by here to Curragh Camp or races, how many
give it a thought or know who built it? I was
told that it was a monastery whose bricks were
passed from hand to hand all the way from Dublin;
others stated that it was an unfinished cotton
factory, and it looks like such.</p>

<p>It is of red brick, two stories in height, and of
great length. Its arches and brickwork are of
the finest, but the whole stands a melancholy
monument to the downfall of human greatness,
to the cowardice of a King.</p>

<p>From whom did Charles I. inherit such a streak?
Certainly not from his Danish mother, or from his
royal grandmother. The worst enemies of the
Stuart Queen never could accuse her of the
desertion of her friends. She was faithful unto
death and should deserve the crown of life for that
reason if for none other. But Lord Darnley was
never faithful to anything throughout his entire
life, and from that source surely came this taint
in the Stuart kings of England&mdash;the degeneracy
of James I., and the cowardice of his son
Charles.</p>

<p>Leaving melancholy Jigginstown behind, we
moved on to the Curragh, but this time to the
camp, which, by the way, is one of the largest
in the empire.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>En route, we chased through a drove of cattle,
one of which, after racing with us for some distance,
decided finally to take our right-of-way, and our
guard sliding under her hind leg, lifted it high off
the ground, causing her to plunge wildly and the
air to be filled with distant oaths and curses from
her owner. She was not hurt at all, and as the
car slid forward and away, clouds of dust hid our
number and defeated all chances of a claim for
damages.</p>

<p>Luncheon with the officers in the mess-tent
being over, we started again citywards, as
my days in the land were growing few indeed,
to my regret, and there were some shrines
which must be visited or my journey would be
incomplete.</p>

<p>En route to the tomb of a great statesman we
paused to pay our homage at that of a great
divine, Dean Swift, who sleeps in the Cathedral
of St. Patrick under a simple tablet. There,
upon an important occasion, when the cathedral
was crowded, he delivered himself of those famous
words, "The Lord loves them that give to the poor,
and if you believe in the security, dump down the
dust,"&mdash;the shortest sermon ever delivered in
St. Patrick's, and the most effective, for "the
dust" came in clouds.</p>

<p>St. Patrick's blessing must be passing from Ireland
at last, as the papers describe the capture
of a brown snake three feet long in a garden at
Ranelagh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Pg 287]</a></span></p>

<p>As we approach the stately cathedral I ask
our boy:</p>

<p>"Is that a Catholic church, Dennis?"</p>

<p>"No, sor."</p>

<p>"A Protestant?"</p>

<p>"No, sor."</p>

<p>"What then?"</p>

<p>"A Church of England, sor."</p>

<p>While these people will generally enter whole-souled
into jest or gibe they will not, it is said, do
so with the English, and some of the encounters
with the latter people are amusing in the extreme.</p>

<p>The other day on the top of a tram car, some
Englishwomen were enlarging upon the not at
all times cleanly inhabitants surrounding them.
One remarked that they were all horrid and she
should go to Wales where she would not meet any
of "these dirty Irish." An old woman across the
tram could no longer restrain herself, but rising
in her wrath, confronted the Englishwoman with
flashing eyes, and "I would not go to Wales ma'am
wur I yez, for yez will find plinty of Irish there;
but take my advice and go to Hell, ye'll find no
Irish there."</p>

<p>A man, killed near Dublin not long since, had
been shot through the forehead, death resulting
instantly. The usual crowd gathered, amongst
them an old woman, who for a moment intently
regarded the poor fellow, dead as Pharoah, then,
raising her hands and eyes, she ejaculated "Wusn't
it a blessin' of God he wusn't shot in the eye!"
    <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
What difference that could have made to him she
disdained to explain.</p>

<p>The last resting place of Daniel O'Connell is in
Prospect Cemetery, some four miles from Dublin.
There Parnell also sleeps under the shadow of a
simple iron cross.</p>

<p>The passing years have called a halt on both of
those men. How little we are conscious of the
flight of time until suddenly we find our thoughts,
which before have all been towards the future,
have unconsciously to us turned towards the
past, and we are looking backward and not
forward. Then we realize with a sinking heart
that for us youth is over and done with, that
for us there is no future save beyond the far
horizon.</p>

<p class="pmb3">The memorial to O'Connell, appropriate in
every respect, rears itself in the stately form of
an ancient round tower. Simple and dignified,
one cannot imagine a more appropriate monument
to the man who sleeps beneath it. The
tower is of grey stone smoothly polished and rises
from a circle under which is the vault of O'Connell.
Around this runs a broad, stone walk which in its
turn is encircled by a rampart, holding many
vaults whose doors open upon the walk, and being
all unlocked you may enter where you will once
you pass the outer gate of the circle, generally
locked. To-day, however, the workmen are redecorating
the O'Connell vault and we are allowed
to enter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span></p>

<p>Passing down a broad flight of steps and through
an iron grill we find confronting us, across the
circular stone pathway, another grill closing the
centre vault, over whose door is the name "O'Connell."
The great Irishman sleeps alone in the
centre of this vault in an altar-like tomb, through
the stone quarterfoils of which you may see and
touch his oaken coffin. The inscription is on a
brass frieze around the top. In an adjoining
catacomb are the coffins of several members of
his family. I think such mausoleums are always
more impressive when the stone walls and ceilings
are unadorned, but such is not the taste here
and the ceilings and walls were being painted
in gorgeous colours.</p>

<p>It is a useless expense, as with the arches and
walls covered with moisture, the work will be
undone very shortly. The plain stone would be
infinitely more impressive and dignified, surely,
like the tower above, more in keeping with the
character of the illustrious dead.</p>

<p class="pmb3">As we leave the cemetery I turned for a last look
at the shrine of Ireland. I have seen, I think,
the final resting places of all the illustrious dead
of the earth, and I know of none which has more
profoundly impressed me than this stately tomb
of Daniel O'Connell, with whose name let us close
these sketches of the land he loved so well&mdash;Ireland.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="pt2 small pmb2">&quot;The author has not only a cultured style and highly descriptive power,
but a quiet, delightful humor. Moreover, he is always interesting, even
when describing the daily incidents of a tour through New Zealand and
Tasmania.... 'Islands of the Southern Seas' is one of the few books
of modern travel that are worthy of being kept and read over and over again.
The illustrations throughout are excellent and as fittingly clear and incisive
as the author's style demands. A more readable book on the nowadays
somewhat hackneyed subject of travel in the Southern Seas has never been
printed, and we unhesitatingly commend it.&quot;&mdash;<i>London Chronicle.</i></p>

<p class="pt2 small pmb2">&quot;Nine people out of ten if asked to name the most romantic figure in
history would without hesitation select the beautiful Queen of Scots, round
whose tragic career more controversy has raged than concerning any other
personage in the history of these islands.... Those who are fascinated
by the great romance, who have as yet made no detailed study of the
period, will find the story here outlined by a trustworthy hand, and adorned
by a wealth of artistic illustration worthy of so picturesque and royal a
theme.&quot;&mdash;<i>St. James's Gazette.</i></p>

<p class="pt2 small">&quot;Mr. Shoemaker's descriptive powers are of the best. He writes entertainingly,
he is never tiresome, and is always enjoyable; his observation and
statements of fact are unusually accurate, his style is pleasant. For big
and for little, with all that makes up the intermediate, 'The Heart of the
Orient,' with its excellent illustrations and its cultured letterpress, is one of
the best books of travel that we have read in a long time.&quot;&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>
